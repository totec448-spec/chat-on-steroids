/**
 * The only code this extension runs in ChatGPT's own JavaScript context.
 *
 * A collapsed connector row shows the word "Called tool" and
 * nothing else, but the React Fiber behind it already knows exactly which tool ran, under
 * which connector, and how many further calls that single row is standing in for. That
 * last part is why this file has to exist at all — the page renders one row for a run of
 * calls, not always to the same tool, so the visible rows are not a list of the calls, and
 * no amount of DOM reading from the isolated world can recover the ones it folded away.
 * The same bounded bridge also reads account-evaluated model choices and the installed
 * connector's public tool declarations. Neither path exports account/session objects or
 * invokes React action callbacks; the named serverId$ signal is read only for durable
 * conversation identity. The isolated world owns UI actions and operation claims.
 *
 * Everything here is written on the assumption that it is the least trusted code in the
 * extension:
 *
 *  · **It runs where the page can reach it.** ChatGPT could replace `JSON.parse`,
 *    `postMessage`, `Array.prototype.map` — anything this file touches. Native references
 *    are captured at load, before the page has had a chance to react to us, and the file
 *    is kept short so there is little to subvert.
 *  · **It emits an allowlist, never a filtered copy.** Only the named fields below cross
 *    into the extension. Copying the props and deleting the sensitive parts would be a
 *    denylist, and one renamed field would be a leak — the request JSON has been observed
 *    carrying tool arguments verbatim.
 *  · **It emits no argument values at all, and does not even parse them.** Tool arguments
 *    are the user's own text and this app's own secrets, and there is no key-level
 *    allowlist that generalises across tools. The request payload is never handed to
 *    `JSON.parse`; only the tool path anchored at the very front of it is read, so `args`
 *    is never walked at all. The tool's identity is what relabelling actually needs; the
 *    app already knows the arguments for every call it ran itself.
 *  · **It fails closed.** An unrecognised Fiber shape yields `null` for that row, which
 *    leaves the row exactly as ChatGPT drew it. Guessing would put a wrong tool name on a
 *    real call, which is worse than the generic label it replaced.
 *
 * The receiving side treats everything here as page-controlled evidence regardless: the
 * page can post these same messages itself. See the trust note in content.js.
