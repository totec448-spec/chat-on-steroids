# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

This project is in **beta** despite the 1.x version number. Behavior may still change between
releases.

The app and the `extension/` companion are versioned together. **Reload the
extension after updating the app**. If their bridge protocols are incompatible,
the app refuses the extension and asks you to reload the matching copy.

## [1.9.5] — 2026-08-23

### Added
- **The extension requirement is explicit where sub-agents are configured.** Setup now says
  worker chats require the companion extension to be loaded and connected, Chat settings repeats
  that requirement, and Setup includes a direct download link for the standalone extension ZIP.

### Fixed
- **Sub-agents can be enabled without restarting Chat On Steroids.** Swarm persistence hooks are
  now wired for the lifetime of the main process instead of only when multi-agent was enabled at
  startup, so the first `spawn` after enabling the feature can cross its durable acceptance
  barrier normally.

## [1.9.4] — 2026-08-22

### Added
- **Native Windows x64 and ARM64 release packaging.** Release candidates build and smoke-test
  each architecture on a matching Windows runner, bundle the matching tunnel/search assets and
  Chrome extension, and assemble explicit installers plus an extension zip and SHA-256 manifest.

### Changed
- **Fresh installs start fully enabled.** All file, command and desktop permissions begin on,
  read-only mode begins off, and multi-agent starts enabled with the existing two-worker
  default. Existing configs keep their explicit choices, and a corrupt config still recovers
  conservatively rather than treating damage as permission consent.
- **The Home activity log starts shorter**, leaving more vertical room for permissions,
  folders and health without changing the activity view itself.
- **Public setup and security guidance was refreshed for release.** The landing page now calls
  out the separate x64/ARM64 installers, bundled-extension install path, unsigned SmartScreen
  warning, current ChatGPT MCP access limits, and the experimental browser-automation terms risk.

### Fixed
- **Compact & Resume and browser-command recovery are durable across failures and restarts.**
  Continuation transitions now persist before publication, queued/leased browser commands and
  final receipts survive restart, and a committed resume cannot be cancelled by a late timeout
  or lost HTTP response.
- **Multi-agent finish and recovery paths are deterministic.** Terminal worker retries can
  recover their final result without reviving the worker, critical broker state has an awaited
  durability barrier, and resume transfers repair only from durable recovery evidence.
- **The extension no longer drops recoverable work on transient/protocol failures.** 426 keeps
  the observation journal for retry, command acknowledgements use a storage-backed outbox, and
  retry alarms are kept stable until durable work drains.
- **Browser/Fiber attribution is stricter under navigation and reused UI state.** Scan identity,
  request ownership and chronology stay fail-closed when ChatGPT reuses rows, ids or documents.
- **Session/catalog races no longer resurrect stale ownership.** Conversation attachment lookup,
  first-sight initialization and asset accounting now preserve the durable session as authority.

### Performance
- Reduced repeated filesystem scans and metadata calls in `read`, glob expansion and fallback
  search; reused already-read bytes for binary/encoding detection and reduced ripgrep buffer
  copying.
- Removed repeated browser journal/chronology scans and batched request-correlation persistence;
  streaming session messages now compare their fixed stored-text shape without repeatedly
  serializing large prose.

## [1.9.3] — 2026-08-21

### Changed
- **The app is now called Chat On Steroids.** The installer, the window, the connector
  names and the extension all use the new name. Two consequences on upgrade: the new
  build installs alongside the old one rather than over it, and settings live in a new
  folder (`%APPDATA%\chat-on-steroids\`), so the stored API key and recorded sessions
  do not carry across. **Reload the extension** — the bridge handshake changed with the
  name, and an old extension is refused with a visible error rather than failing quietly.
- **`spawn` takes a shared `context`.** The repository, the conventions file, what not to
  touch, how to validate, what to report — written once for the batch, and put in front
  of every worker's own task. Each `task` now carries only that worker's objective.
- **`message` sends a batch.** `action='message'` accepts a `messages` array as well as a
  single `to`/`text`: three redirected workers are one tool call instead of three, and
  the batch is delivered in full or not at all.
- **Every `agents` reply carries machine-readable state** beside its sentence of prose —
  the run, the caller, each agent and anything queued — so the model reads state rather
  than parsing English.
- **Workers are asked for a structured handoff**: RESULT, CHANGES, VALIDATION, BLOCKERS.
- **The preamble typed into a worker's chat is three lines shorter**, saying only who it
  is and how to report.
- **A closed tab no longer ends a worker.** A ChatGPT turn runs on OpenAI's servers, so
  closing the tab loses this app's view of the worker rather than stopping it. Such a
  worker shows as *no tab*, keeps its slot, and rejoins the moment it calls again; it is
  given up on only once it has also gone quiet.

### Removed
- **`agents(action='join')` and its recovery key, entirely.** It was the last credential
  in the app and the only field a model could present as identity. A worker is the chat
  the app opened for it; a binding that goes missing is restored by the extension
  reporting the chat, not by pasting a key. The desktop window's recovery-key button is
  gone with it.

## [1.9.2] — 2026-08-21

Pre-public beta milestone.

### Fixed
- Harvest the request id before ChatGPT's safety check releases it. The id used to
  correlate a tool call with the turn that caused it could be gone by the time it
  was read, which surfaced as calls landing under the wrong turn or under
  *Unattributed activity*.

## [1.9.1] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- Attribute MCP calls that arrive without a `data-turn-id`. ChatGPT does not always
  stamp the attribute; those calls previously fell through to *Unattributed*.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- Live transcript ownership and chronology. Turn identity could leak from an older
  generation into a newer one, progress ids could be reused across generations, and
  the same semantic tool row could be recorded two or three times under
  index-derived ids. Identity is now scoped per generation rather than trusting a
  DOM attribute that survives React node reuse.

## [1.8.9] — 2026-08-21

### Changed
- Hardening pass across MCP lifecycle, path handling and process control.
- The test suite terminates reliably instead of leaving stray workers behind.

## [1.8.4] — 2026-08-20

### Added
- Refreshed application icon.
- Current Codex-derived base tools ported to Core.

### Fixed
- Turn-killer bug; session identity now survives a reload.
- Live transcript capture and attribution repair.

## [1.7.6] — 2026-08-18

### Changed
- Reduced model-facing tool surface from 45 tools / ~60 kB to 12.5 kB across six
  core tools and 7.9 kB across two desktop tools, with those sizes held as test
  budgets. See [`docs/tool-surface.md`](docs/tool-surface.md).

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-15

### Changed
- Hardened MCP workflows and process control.
- Corrected the documented Electron user-data path.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- Transactional batch edits and process output cursors.
