/**
 * Issue #76: a left-handed mouse turned every default click into a right-click.
 *
 * SendInput's flags name *physical* buttons, and Windows applies the `SM_SWAPBUTTON` swap when it
 * turns a physical press into the message an application receives. So on a swapped mouse the app's
 * `left` — which callers mean as "the primary button" — arrived as the secondary click, opening
 * context menus instead of activating things.
 *
 * Measured on Windows 11 before the fix, by injecting into a window the probe owned so no real UI
 * was clicked, with the setting restored afterwards:
 *
 *     swap on, MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN  sent -> WM_RBUTTONDOWN   (the bug)
 *     swap on, MOUSEEVENTF_RIGHTDOWN sent -> WM_LBUTTONDOWN   (the fix)
 *
 * The mapping lives inside the embedded C#, so it cannot be called from here; what this pins is
 * the source contract. Deliberately asserted as whole down/up pairs rather than as "the file
 * mentions SM_SWAPBUTTON", because the ways this regresses are partial: swapping the down flag and
 * not the up, fixing `left` and forgetting `right`, or dropping the runtime read for a constant.
