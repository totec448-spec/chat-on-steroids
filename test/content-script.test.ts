   * The gap a live macOS QA session lost two real user messages to, on 2026-09-04.
   *
   * There are two independent writers for a user message, and the Fiber one defers to the DOM
   * one by id: `renderedUserMessageIds` is meant to say "the DOM recorder owns these". But the
   * set was built from `role === 'user' && message.id`, while the DOM loop only actually
   * journals a row that also has text and is neither retired nor stale. Any row satisfying the
   * weaker predicate but not the stronger one therefore fell between them: the DOM loop skipped
   * it before it was ever classified, and Fiber — which had the text from the page model all
   * along — saw its id in the set and deferred. Nothing emitted it, and nothing ever would.
   *
   * `data-message-id` is set on the container while `.whitespace-pre-wrap` is still empty, so
   * this is a normal render window ChatGPT passes through on every send, not an exotic state.
