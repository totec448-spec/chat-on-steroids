/**
 * The model-facing surfaces this app publishes, and what each one is for.
 *
 * ChatGPT connects to one MCP server per connector, and the *whole* of that server's
 * tool list is one discovery unit: `api_tool.list_resources(paths=["Name"])` with no
 * query returns every schema the server advertises. A query narrows it, but nothing
 * guarantees the harness will ask a narrow one, so the honest planning number for a
 * surface is its complete tools/list — not the subset a lucky query would return.
 *
 * That is the entire reason this file exists. Splitting into separate servers is the
 * only mechanism that actually bounds the worst case, because a separate server is a
 * separate discovery boundary that no query can cross.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a splitting free-for-all. Every extra surface is another
 * connector the user has to create, name, describe and keep connected, and on the
 * OpenAI tunnel it is another tunnel id as well (see `docs/tool-surface.md` §6.4).
 * A surface has to earn that. The test applied here is: a distinct capability boundary
 * the user already thinks in, plus enough schema weight that folding it into Core
 * would meaningfully raise Core's no-query cost.
 *
 * Two surfaces pass that test today.

 *    no discovery benefit.
 *
 * Core declares 8 possible tool names below, but at most 7 schemas are live at once. `find`
