/**
 * Which durable local session owns a live `exec_command` process.
 *
 * Codex never needs this. It hangs `UnifiedExecProcessManager` off `session.services`, so a
 * session cannot even name another session's process: the manager it reaches is a
 * different object. This connector is one long-lived main process serving every chat through
 * one manager, so the same session ids are in scope everywhere, and `write_stdin(session_id)`
 * on a numeric id from another chat would otherwise reach that chat's shell.
 *
 * This is an authorization boundary. A proven owner can only be continued by that same durable
 * session, whose frontend attachment may legitimately change from A to B during Compact & Resume.
 * Legacy/single-chat calls that carry no request identity are kept in a separate
 * anonymous bucket so existing terminal semantics still work, but a later proven chat cannot
 * adopt such a session and an anonymous call cannot touch a proven-owned session.

 * trigger, and that is the second shape of a turn that reads as stuck — the model launched
 * something, moved on, and nothing in the loop ever mentioned it again. Two minutes is past any
 * yield an `exec_command` can ask for (30s) and well short of a real build.

 * and it is gone, while a dev server or a `tail -f` is *meant* to sit there for the whole turn.
