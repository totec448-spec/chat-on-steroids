/**
 * The local bridge between the Chrome extension and this app.
 *
 * A second loopback server, separate from the MCP endpoint, because the two have
 * opposite requirements: the MCP endpoint refuses any browser origin on purpose,
 * while this one exists to be called by a browser extension.
 *
 * What keeps it safe:
 *   · 127.0.0.1 only, never 0.0.0.0
 *   · the only unauthenticated routes are /hello (a fixed identifying string) and
 *     /pair, which issues the token to a caller on 127.0.0.1 — see the route for what
 *     that deliberately does and does not buy
 *   · every other route needs the bearer token issued by /pair, compared in
 *     constant time, and stored encrypted rather than in config.json
 *   · the Origin must be a chrome-extension:// or moz-extension:// origin, so a web page cannot drive it
 *   · bodies are capped and requests are rate limited
 *
 * It is deliberately not a general control API. It accepts observations about a
 * ChatGPT conversation and hands back activity summaries and queued commands. It
 * cannot read a file, run anything, or change a permission.

/**
 * A final-tab close of a chat this app is owed a running turn in is one no-tab recovery episode.
 *
 * Whether the app is owed that turn is its own question, not the page's parting word. The page
 * decides "generating" from the Stop control, and a document being torn down has none: on
 * 2026-09-03 worker-1's page reported its turn completed one second before its `/closed`, while
 * the same request id went on calling tools straight through the close. So the answer is the
 * strongest fact available: the page's own open turn when it has one, an attributed call or
 * current-turn observation inside the silence window — this app's standing definition of a
 * chat that is working, read from its activity ledger before the close ends it — or a worker
 * slot that was working when the tab went (the close itself detached it; a sleeping worker's
 * tab closing is not an event). A Prime or Worker is what `recoverAgentTabs` is a
 * preference about; a Goal/Loop chat is always brought back; any other chat qualifies on the one
 * fact that makes it this app's business — it has proved at least one MCP call. A chat that has
 * never called a tool is the user's own browsing: closing it is not a failure, and reopening it
 * would be this app helping itself to a tab nobody asked it to keep.
 *
 * The silence deadline would eventually reopen any of them, but only two minutes after the last
 * sign of life. A closed tab is first-hand proof that the page is gone *now*, and acting on it
 * is the whole difference between a chat that comes straight back and one the user watches
 * fail to. The episode is stamped with the moment the page went, never with the chat's moving
 * activity deadline: a detached chat goes on calling tools server-side, and a stamp that tracked
 * activity would mint a fresh episode — and a second tab — out of the very work this repair
 * exists to keep alive.
 *
 * Every verdict is logged, because "I closed it and nothing happened" is otherwise
 * indistinguishable from a close the extension never reported.
