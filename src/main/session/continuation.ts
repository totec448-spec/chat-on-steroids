/**
 * The one-time transaction that moves a local session from one ChatGPT chat to another.
 *
 * Compact & Resume is not "summarise, then start again somewhere else". The local session is
 * the durable identity — its recorded history, its title, its workspace, its handoffs, and
 * the swarm it may be coordinating all belong to it — and chats A and B are only two ChatGPT
 * frontends attached to it in turn. So there is exactly one state-transfer mechanism here,
 * the rebind, and the handoff brief is *model context only*: it exists so the model in chat
 * B knows what was happening, not so the app can reconstruct anything from it.
 *
 * ## The transaction
 *
 *   open    — the user pressed the button. The prime binding is pinned so the run does not
 *             die when chat A goes away, and nothing else has changed yet.
 *   summary — ChatGPT's final answer for that exact compaction turn arrived and was stored
 *             as the handoff. Only now is there anything worth opening a chat for.
 *   claim   — one replacement chat, and only one, takes this continuation. A second claimant
 *             is refused rather than served, which is what stops two chats from both
 *             believing they are the continuation.
 *   commit  — chat B proved it exists and accepted the handoff, so the session moves.
 *   abort   — anything went wrong. The session stays attached to chat A, which is the
 *             failure mode every step is arranged around.
 *
 * ## Why commit cannot half-happen
 *
 * The commit is three phases, in this order and for this reason:
 *
 *   preflight — everything that could *decline* is asked before anything is written, and the
 *               answers are pinned. The swarm handover is the one that matters: it is frozen
 *               here, and a session that is a run's prime with no usable handover is refused
 *               outright rather than moved without its swarm.
 *   durable   — the session rebind, the only step that can fail. It stages the change, writes
 *               it atomically, and publishes it into memory only once the write has landed, so
 *               a failure leaves chat A attached in memory *and* on disk. On failure the
 *               preflight is undone: the freeze is released and the transaction is claimable
 *               again.
 *   publish   — the live recorder mapping, the workspace key, the swarm's prime binding. Pure
 *               in-memory map work, none of it able to throw or to change its mind, running
 *               only once the durable record already says chat B.
 *
 * So there is no window in which the session is in B while the workspace or the swarm is
 * still in A. The one thing the publish phase can still find missing is the run itself, if it
 * ended while the write was in flight — and a run that no longer exists has no prime left in
 * chat A to be inconsistent with.
 *
 * The state is flipped to `committing` *synchronously*, before the first await, so two
 * replacement chats racing to commit cannot both pass the check; the loser is refused and
 * the winner's failure restores the state for a retry. Nothing else may move the state
 * backwards out of `committing` — see {@link claimContinuationNow}, which is monotonic for
 * exactly that reason.
