/**
 * The user's stop button for a ChatGPT turn that ChatGPT itself will no longer stop.
 *
 * A wedged ChatGPT page can leave a turn running with no working Stop control: the model
 * keeps issuing connector calls, the user can neither see the turn's messages nor cancel it,
 * and every one of those calls arrives here as an ordinary, correctly attributed request. The
 * app cannot end that server-side turn — nothing it can reach owns it. What it does own is
 * whether the turn gets to touch this machine, and refusing every tool it calls is enough:
 * a model with no working tools and an explicit instruction to stop answers and ends the turn.
 *
 * The blocked thing is a **conversation**, not a request id, even though a request id is what
 * the refusal is actually matched on. `correlation.ts` already proves `requestId ->
 * conversationId` exactly, and one ChatGPT turn issues all of its connector calls under one
 * request id, so a conversation is the only key that stays true for the whole rogue turn and
 * for the next one after it. Enumerating request ids would ban the turn the user was looking
 * at and nothing the same chat did a second later.
 *
 * The block is therefore exact-identity only, and deliberately so: it refuses a call whose
 * proven owner is blocked and never a call whose owner is merely unknown. Guessing here would
 * refuse an innocent chat's file read to punish a different chat's turn, which is the trade this
 * whole codebase refuses to make everywhere else.
 *
 * What that costs, and where it was originally got wrong: "the user blocks a chat whose request
 * id is already proven" is true of the turn the user was looking at and of nothing after it. A
 * new turn brings a new request id, and a wedged page — the whole reason this exists — is the
 * page least able to report one promptly. Enforcement that only read already-proven identity
 * therefore let a blocked chat keep running tools that the recorder, which does wait for late
 * evidence, then filed under that same blocked chat. Waiting for the exact request-id mate is
 * not guessing, so the enforcement gate in kernel.ts waits exactly as long as attribution does.
 *
 * Blocks are durable and released only by the user. A restart is not a reason to hand a rogue
 * turn its tools back; the turn can outlive the app.
