 * Two permissions were removed when the tools were consolidated, because no tool could

 * label promises — is a lie about the security boundary:
 *
 * - `powershell` and `command` were one tool each. `exec_command` replaced both, and it
 *   runs PowerShell by default, so leaving the pair in place meant "Run executable" was
 *   silently also "Run PowerShell" while the PowerShell checkbox granted nothing at all.
 *   One permission for running commands is what the single tool can actually enforce.
 * - `deleteFolder` had no implementation left: `apply_patch` deletes files, and the patch
 *   format has no way to express removing a directory. Deleting a folder now needs
 *   `exec_command`, which is a permission the user grants deliberately.
 *
 * `config.ts` migrates both keys off existing configs; see the note there.
