/**
 * The order a recorded turn is *read* in, which is not the order it was written in.
 *
 * A tool call is only handed to the recorder once its tool has finished and its attribution
 * has resolved, so it is appended late — but it is stamped with `startedAt`, because that is
 * when it happened. Everything the page observed in the meantime already has a lower `seq`.
 * Reading the log by `seq` therefore shows a call after the commentary it ran underneath, and
 * a slow call after the `turn_end` of the turn that made it: `2000-01-01-00000001` seq 390,
 * `time` 1786982781914, sits after a `turn_start` stamped 1786982783350 — a second and a half
 * in the future of the row above it.
 *
 * The fix is not to sort the log by time. `seq` is the append order and the cursor domain,
 * and it has to stay immutable and gap-free or incremental delivery breaks. And a global
 * sort by time would be actively wrong: a reloaded page re-reports the transcript it can see,
 * and those events carry the time they were *observed*, not the time they were said, so
 * sorting the whole log by time drags days-old history into the middle of the live turn.
 *
 * So ordering is turn-local. A turn this log opened is a durable, bounded group — everything
 * in it carries the same generation id, which the extension mints per turn — and inside that
 * group the recorded times are all live observations of one run, directly comparable. Outside
 * it nothing moves: user messages, turn boundaries, and any event whose turn this window does
 * not contain keep the position `seq` gave them.
 *
 * Both consumers use this. The desktop transcript and the stream the extension injects back
 * into ChatGPT are the same record, and they must not be able to disagree about its order.

 * The assistant message that ended a turn, if this group holds one.
 *
 * A message carries the `create_time` ChatGPT stamped when it *opened* that message, and
 * ChatGPT can open the final answer and still run another connector call before the prose is
 * written. Session `2000-01-01-00000003` is the live case: the answer of turn `…-1-9` is
 * stamped 08:40:34, with `write_stdin` at 08:40:37 and `git show` at 08:40:42 after it. Order
 * that group by time alone and two tool rows are drawn *underneath* the finished answer —
 * which is neither what ChatGPT itself shows nor a thing that can have happened.
 *
 * The message that ended a turn is the last thing in that turn by definition: nothing else in
 * the turn can follow the message that closed it. So it is placed there, rather than trusted
 * to a timestamp that describes when it was opened.
 *
 * Only one message per group moves, the one furthest along the log. A turn re-observed after a
 * reload can have every message marked final, and interim prose must keep interleaving with
 * the tool calls it ran between — the terminal message is the only one whose position is a
 * matter of definition rather than observation.
