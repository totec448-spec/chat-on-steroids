/**
 * What's New: the highlights of the version the app just updated to, once (#1172).
 *
 * The highlights are the release notes' own Highlights, shortened, and written in each release PR
 * next to the notes. Literal `t()` calls keep the catalog audit able to see each key, so every
 * language ships them like the rest of the interface. A version without an entry shows nothing.
