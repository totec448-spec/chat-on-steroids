# Chat On Steroids — the agent map

**QUALITY >> QUANTITY. Delete before adding.** Improve the underlying decision/ownership structure
and replace obsolete logic; never stack a fallback, watcher, state machine or special case around a
bad invariant. Prefer one deterministic source of truth, fewer branches and reuse of existing
mechanisms. Every change should make the affected system smaller, simpler and easier to reason about
where practical. Fix problems from the ground up; do not grow the codebase to hide them.

**No build-up: rewrite the affected subsystem with the new feature/invariant in mind.** Do not keep
the old architecture and bolt a new path beside it merely because that is the smallest diff. When a
new implementation supersedes an old assumption, recode that specific area around the new source of
truth, delete the obsolete branches/state/fallbacks it replaces, and converge callers/tests on that
one design. This is not permission for broad rewrites: change only the affected subsystem, but leave
it architecturally cleaner and preferably smaller than before.

**Rule: no build up; rewrite with the new feature in mind.**

**Browser efficiency rules.** Opening the app, a suspended MV3 wake socket and a maintenance
alarm are not permission to open a tab. Reuse a suitable existing document. One operation owns
one elected tab across provider navigation and MV3 suspension; a missing receipt or a user-closed
tab must not create a new opening attempt. Transfer opening authority at handout, not after page
hydration. Keep waiting chats and reusable sleeping workers open for follow-ups. Only terminal,
blocked or superseded conversations and proven duplicates grant tab-close authority,
subject to the existing draft/generation/document checks.
Read bounded account-evaluated model metadata and installed tool declarations through the existing
MAIN-world bridge. Do not infer availability from English labels or fixed release names, sweep every
effort to discover a catalog, or add polling/fallback openers around an uncertain observation.

Native attachments have one staging owner in `session/input-attachments.ts`: immutable originals,
bounded thumbnails, serialized quota/pruning/admission and opaque IDs. The outbox owns membership;
the bridge serves bounded chunks only to that exact pre-send browser claim. Never expose source
paths or inject a file reference as though its bytes reached ChatGPT. Final Send must recheck the
same text, attachment nodes and navigation epoch after every asynchronous authorization step.
Pending plan stages are projected from the first durable input until its receipt materializes the
queue. Temporary planner tabs retire after capture/cancellation only with exact idle/draft proof.

**This tree is usually dirty and shared with the user and other agents — never `reset`,
`checkout`, `clean`, reformat, or overwrite work you did not do.**

The single orientation document for this repository. Read it before changing anything.

**How to use it.** §1–§3 is the mental model; read those once, in order. §4 is "where is the
thing" plus the mechanism ledger: every durable fact, owner, lifetime and publication boundary
that matters across subsystems. §5–§17 is one section per subsystem, each with the same shape —
what it owns, its files, its flow, **what must hold**, how it fails, which tests cover it. §18 is
the fastest entry point when you have a symptom and no theory. §19–§22 is how to work here.

**One file, complete.** This replaces the old `AGENTS.md` + `agent.md` split, which
duplicated roughly 60% of its content and had already drifted between copies. It is sized
for completeness rather than for any tool's default project-document budget; if your
harness truncates long project docs, raise its limit rather than cutting this down.

## 1. The app in sixty seconds

A **Windows/macOS/Linux Electron app** that hands ChatGPT a deliberately small set of local
computer capabilities over MCP. It is a desktop chat workspace, bridge and permission layer. ChatGPT still hosts model execution; the extension transports desktop input and observes the provider UI. It also ships a Chrome extension that watches ChatGPT itself, so the app can
record conversations, prove which conversation issued which tool call, replace generic tool
rows with what actually happened, compact a long chat into a fresh one, and run worker chats.
Core is portable; the Desktop/computer-use surface has native Windows and macOS backends behind
one protocol and must be absent from live Linux capability/discovery state.

Four runtime planes, only two of which are servers:

**The MCP server and the browser bridge are two different servers with two different
threat models.** MCP is the model's capability endpoint. The bridge exists only for the
Chrome extension and has no arbitrary filesystem, command or permission authority. Its attachment
route serves only immutable user-selected staging bytes belonging to an exact claimed input.
Never merge their lifecycles or their auth.

The extension never executes a tool. It observes ChatGPT and reports evidence. **The app is
the only authority on what a local tool actually did.** The renderer has no Node, no
filesystem, no command, no network authority; it crosses preload through named IPC.

## 2. Where the bugs actually are

Almost nothing hard here is a local algorithm bug. The hard ones live on six boundaries:

| Boundary | The two things people confuse |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery vs. enforcement | a schema ChatGPT cached vs. a permission that is live *now* |
| Path spelling | `/project/src/a.ts` vs. a native `C:\work\...` or `/home/...` path — same decision required |
| Request vs. conversation | HTTP `x-request-id` vs. the ChatGPT conversation that owns it |
| Process lifetime | content script (document) vs. service worker (suspends) vs. app (restarts) |
| Durable vs. frontend identity | local session id vs. the ChatGPT conversation attached to it |
| Async vs. selection | a load started for A vs. the B the user has since selected |

If a bug looks like four subsystems failing at once, it is one of these, once. Find the
**earliest wrong identity or state transition** — not the last UI that displayed it.

### Name the identity, then find where it is lost

Every boundary above is a place where one specific identity is supposed to survive. Before
reading any code, say which one this bug is about. If you cannot state it, you have not
found the real boundary yet.

| Plane | The identity that must survive |
| --- | --- |
| filesystem | approved root + canonical real path |
| MCP call | normalized request id |
| tool ownership | request id -> conversation id |
| browser observation | conversation id + navigation epoch + message/turn identity |
| agent | conversation id -> prime or worker slot |
| workspace | conversation/agent key -> cwd |
| terminal | proven owner -> exec session id |
| session | local session id + conversation lineage |
| compaction | continuation token + from/to conversation |
| renderer load | selected session id + load generation |
| connection | tunnel/endpoint generation |
| desktop coordinates | screenshot frame id |

Then classify which plane produced the **first** wrong fact — MCP transport/discovery,
permission/sandbox/tool runtime, browser observation/identity, bridge/session/agent
orchestration, renderer presentation, or tunnel/packaging. Do not start in the file where
the symptom is displayed.

Three policies apply everywhere and are not repeated per section:

- **Fail closed** when a guess could cause cross-root access, cross-chat attribution,
  cross-agent terminal control, wrong workspace mutation, wrong compaction target, unsafe
  rendered HTML, or invalid image content reaching the model. For presentation-only
  degradation, keep the UI usable and label the uncertainty instead.
- **Scope every async result to the epoch that requested it** — navigation epoch, load
  generation, connection generation, endpoint lifetime. Id equality alone is not enough:
  an A → B → A navigation defeats it.
- **Bound every representation of large output** — bytes, tokens, decoded pixels, base64,
  structured fields. Not just the visible text, and not just the compressed input.

## 3. What is authoritative

Sources disagree here because the architecture moved fast. Precedence:

1. current implementation **plus a reproducible test or live repro**;
2. current declarations: `mcp/surfaces.ts`, `mcp/tools-core.ts`, `mcp/tools-desktop.ts`,
   `shared/types.ts`, `package.json`, `main/version.ts`, `extension/manifest.json`;
3. `README.md`;
4. public design references such as `docs/tool-surface.md`. Internal working notes and
   security reproductions are maintainer-only; a public clone should treat §5–§18 of this
   file as the architecture and design record.

**Code comments in this project are unusually load-bearing.** Many name the exact live
failure that motivated a guard. Read the comment before deleting the guard or "simplifying"
the state machine. Code and current tests still win when a comment has drifted.

### Baseline

Release numbers are authoritative in `package.json`, `src/main/version.ts` and
`extension/manifest.json`; the bridge protocol is `version.ts::BRIDGE_PROTOCOL`. Tests assert
the app/extension versions stay in sync, so this architecture guide deliberately does not
copy a release number that can drift. Core is cross-platform; main process is TypeScript;
extension is plain MV3 JavaScript with no build step; Vitest; `node-pty` is the main native
terminal dependency. Desktop automation is available through native Windows and macOS backends.

Fresh-install defaults from `config.ts` — **Core tool permissions on except opt-in ChatGPT file saving**, **read-only off**,
**recording on**, session advisory/limit **400k/533k** estimated tokens, **auto-compaction on
at 400k and level-based with live-work gating**, **multi-agent on** with `maxWorkers` 2 (hard max 8).
Fresh multi-agent also starts with `allowUnattributedCalls=true`; `recoverAgentTabs` starts **off**
everywhere, because Goal/Loop chats are recovered regardless of it (see §11).
That `true` is `FIRST_LAUNCH_MULTI_AGENT` only; `DEFAULT_MULTI_AGENT` — the schema/migration
baseline that fills the field in when an older config never wrote it — stays `false`.
Fresh installs also start with **zero approved roots**: enabled permissions are not usable
filesystem/command authority until the user approves a root, and `connection.ts` refuses to
publish a root-requiring Core surface until one exists. The limit is
derived, never typed: the Chat panel offers one threshold and writes `limit = threshold × 4/3`,
so the defaults have to satisfy that relation or the first save in that panel moves the red
line. Existing
configs keep explicit user choices; conservative migration defaults do not widen omitted legacy
permissions merely because the fresh-install defaults are broader. Windows also enables the
Desktop capability group. macOS has the native backend but a fresh install starts that group **off**
(`config.ts::firstLaunchCapabilities`): the user switches it on and grants Screen Recording and
Accessibility. Linux masks the group off at runtime while preserving stored choices so a config
moved to a supported host does not lose them.

### Stale-doc traps

Do not "restore" these from an older document:

- `view_image` is its own Core tool, not a mode of `read`.
- Live tool counts derive from `mcp/surfaces.ts` and current exposure: `find` and the exec pair are mutually exclusive, `session_finish` is conditional, and Desktop is a separate surface. Never restore a hardcoded count from older releases.
- `session` has exactly two actions, `search` and `read`. Search discovers recordings; read
  requires an explicit local session id and returns cursor-paged history **without silently
  truncating authored user/assistant rows**. Tool rows are intentionally compact headlines with
  exact args/results behind separately cursor-paged `T…` detail reads, and any pre-existing
  recorder overflow loss is surfaced explicitly. Compact & Resume is app/browser orchestration —
  there is no model-visible `save_handoff`.
- Extension pairing is silent loopback `/pair` bearer provisioning. The six-digit flow is gone.
- Canonical messages live in `messages/*.json`, one replaceable shard per logical id; legacy
  `messages.json` is read during lazy migration. They are not appended forever to `events.jsonl`.
- `computer` carries **13** action variants, not 11.
- Fresh-install multi-agent is **enabled** by `defaultConfig()` through
  `FIRST_LAUNCH_MULTI_AGENT`; the older prose comment in `shared/types.ts` that says the feature is
  disabled by default is simply stale against fresh-install behavior. `config.ts::DEFAULT_MULTI_AGENT`
  remains the conservative schema/migration baseline; `defaultConfig()` is the fresh-install authority.
- Reusable workers normally **sleep after `finish` and are meant to be messaged again**. Server
  instructions and `agents` results must tell primes to reuse a suitable sleeping worker with
  `action=message` before spawning a replacement. Only terminal workers whose own context reached
  the 400k ceiling need replacing.
- `mcp/instructions.ts::coreInstructions()` also still carries a root example shaped like
  `${firstRoot}/src/main.ts`. That silently assumes the approved root *is* the project. Live Core
  tool contracts in `tools-core.ts` are the authority: an approved root is often the **parent** of
  the project, so every intermediate folder remains explicit (`/me/projects/app/...`,
  not `/me/src/...`). There is no model-visible `list_roots` fallback that makes the old example
  safe; fix the instruction text/tests rather than teaching tools to guess a missing project level.
- Ordinary Goal continues **completed final answers only**; Astra is finish-tool-only (see §17). Older README/working-note wording that
  says an `interrupted` turn is automatically continued is stale against `content.js::GOAL_CONTINUABLE`.
- The older prose comment near `config.ts` auto-compaction defaults still calls the trigger
  edge-based. Live authority is `store.ts::autoCompactionReady()` + `bridge.ts::chatIsWorking()`:
  **level above threshold + live work**, with no durable one-shot edge. Likewise, a background.js
  comment that implies browser recovery closes duplicate tabs is stale: recovery deterministically
  elects/reloads one exact tab but does not own duplicate-tab cleanup.
- A separate `background.js` maintenance comment still says an unattributed repair is armed after
  twenty seconds. That mixes two different clocks. Live authority is conditional: a call carrying an
  unresolved request id may wait up to the recorder's **20-second request-id grace**; a call with no
  request id has no ownership proof to await and lands Unattributed immediately. Either resulting
  **Unattributed verdict** then starts `bridge.ts::UNATTRIBUTED_REPAIR_MS`, a separate **60-second
  incident** before repair candidates are queued. The extension's 30-second alarm is only the MV3
  wake-up floor for collecting already-decided work; it is not either recovery deadline. Several
  `content.js` comments still carry old recorder timings: the Fiber request-id note says **15s**,
  `streamTurnGroups()` says **5s**, and the compaction `TOOL_SETTLE_MS` rationale says **15s**. Live
  authority is `recorder.ts::REQUEST_ID_GRACE_MS = evidenceWindow(20_000)`. That last comment also
  predates the running-vs-settling split: Compact & Resume waits app-reported **running local tools**,
  not the recorder's attribution tail. Treat all three as comment drift, not alternate timers.
- `multiAgent.recoverAgentTabs` is one switch with one meaning, read through
  `bridge.ts::tabRecoveryWanted()`: whether **silence** and **no-tab** recovery may bring back a chat
  that the Goal/Loop switch is *not* driving — workers, primes, plain chats with recorded tool calls.
  A Goal/Loop chat (`goalActiveFor()`) is always brought back. Unattributed, assistant-error, Goal
  watch and compaction pickups are reloads of a broken page and are not gated by it.
- `bridge.ts` still has two misleading comments near the live recovery/command structures. The
  `lastBrowserRecoveryAt` comment says one cooldown covers errors, silence and missing tabs, but
  `queueBrowserRecovery()` explicitly gives `silence` and `goal` no cooldown and applies the 3m floor
  only to `unattributed` / `assistant-error` / `no-tab`. `Command.owner` also says a restored command
  has no waiting page and is memory-only; live `DurableCommandRecord` serializes/restores exact
  `owner` + `claimedAt` for valid leases. Trust the record/restore code and tests, not those comments.
- Goal source comments have two current semantic drifts too. `goal.ts` still says a per-chat Off row
  can never be revived by any later app-wide change, but deliberate app-wide master-Off clears those
  rows. `bridge.ts::inspectOwedGoals()` still says a pending Goal reply “travels to the replacement”
  during Compact & Resume; production moves objective + chat switch only and currently leaves the
  reply row on A. Treat both comments as stale against the mechanisms documented below.
- `test/update.test.ts` still contains prose that the next retry schedule is only “the next time the
  app opens”. Production `update.ts::startUpdateChecks()` now runs an immediate pass plus an
  unreferenced six-hour schedule. Current update tests cover the immediate/unreferenced timer lifetime and staging; do not regress production to satisfy the old comment.
- Exec custody is keyed by the durable local `sessionId` carried in `RequestCorrelation`, not the
  replaceable ChatGPT conversation id. Compact & Resume therefore needs no process-owner move: B
  resolves to the same principal and may continue A's live `write_stdin(session_id=...)`, while a
  different session and the anonymous non-adoptable bucket remain fenced. Do not restore the retired
  `moveExecConversationOwners(A,B)` representation or add a resume-only adoption path.

`exec.ts` remains as the shared low-level process/environment primitive used by unified exec,
the Windows desktop helper, macOS in-process worker and tunnels. The retired connector-native managed-process and patch
stacks were removed after production moved to `codex/unified-exec.ts` and `codex/apply-patch/*`;
do not recreate parallel runtimes beside those live owners.

### 4.1 Mechanism ledger — one fact, one owner, one lifetime

Use this table before inventing state. If the fact you need already has an owner here, extend that
owner or derive from it; do not mirror it in another module. “Durable” means it survives an app
restart. Browser `storage.session` survives MV3 service-worker suspension but **not** a browser
restart; `storage.local` survives the browser restart. A memory-only field is allowed only when a
durable or externally re-observable fact can reconstruct it.

| Fact / mechanism | Authoritative owner | Lifetime / durable form | Consumers / invariant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| approved roots + permissions + feature toggles | `config.ts` | `userData/config.json`, atomic temp→rename; validated/migrated on every load | `effectiveCapabilities()` is the live permission projection; malformed existing config recovers conservatively, never as fresh-install consent |
| host capability availability | `platform.ts` + `shared/capabilities.ts` | derived, not stored | Desktop capabilities are impossible off Windows/macOS; every newly added capability is root-required until explicitly classified rootless |
| secrets | `secrets.ts` | OS `safeStorage`; never config/log/renderer | OpenAI, bridge and OpenRouter credentials never cross into untrusted renderer/page state |
| small cross-restart control state | `durable.ts` | named `userData/state/*.json`; per-filename queues, temp→rename; lazy debounced snapshots + explicit `writeDurableNow` generations | independent files can flush concurrently; cross-file transactions require explicit caller awaits; failed generations remain retryable |
| MCP surface shape | `mcp/surfaces.ts` + `server.ts` exposure cache | endpoint lifetime | discovery is a cached schema promise; live permission enforcement is separate and current |
| one MCP request identity | `mcp/inbound.ts` | request lifetime in AsyncLocalStorage | normalize `x-request-id` before any higher-level routing |
| one in-flight call's mutable evidence | `mcp/call-context.ts` | request lifetime | tool outcome/changes/assets/caller travel with the call; wider “settling” lifetime includes attribution + recording after the handler returned |
| request→conversation proof | `session/correlation.ts` | durable named state | only exact request-id evidence is authoritative for modern attribution; every other placement is explicitly weaker/legacy and never a substitute for identity-sensitive routing |
| user-blocked conversations | `session/blocked-chats.ts` | durable named state, released only by the user | the only stop this app can make on a rogue ChatGPT turn. Stored per **conversation**, matched through the existing exact request-id proof, and enforced on nothing else: a call with no proven owner is never blocked |
| local session identity | `session/store.ts` | `sessions/<id>/meta.json` + `events.jsonl` + canonical shards/assets/handoffs | ChatGPT conversation id is a frontend binding; Compact & Resume moves it, never copies the local session |
| canonical authored message identity | `store.ts` + `shared/session.ts` | one replaceable `messages/*.json` shard per logical id | streaming revisions replace the same logical message; event chronology keeps the original anchor/seq |
| mutable timeline progress/activity identity | `shared/session.ts::foldProgress` + recorder/store origins | append snapshots from page/native **or app-owned** progress, folded on read by namespaced `progressId` / page-tool `messageId` | newest content stays at the earliest logical position; unknown identity is never guessed into a fold; app recovery status uses this same mechanism rather than a parallel status store |
| session retention | `session/retention.ts` | process timer, current config read each sweep | startup prune + one coarse six-hour sweep; retention applies to existing history even with recording off |
| model-facing session cursor | `mcp/session-tool.ts` | opaque cursor carried by the caller | cursors pin snapshot/filter/range/open-message checkpoints; stale boundaries fail explicitly rather than silently skipping/repeating history |
| agent-maintained task plan | `session/store.ts::updateSessionPlan` + `shared/agent-plan.ts` | one atomically replaced `sessions/<id>/plan.json`, serialized with session rebind | `update_plan` requires exact request-to-session proof even without workers; retired chats and older calls cannot replace it. `sessionControlsFor` projects it through the existing renderer refresh, scoped to selection generation. Short headlines disclose bounded details above the narrower-than-queue plan card; no queue stages execute or complete from plan status. |
| browser pairing / presence | `extension/background.js` + `bridge.ts` | token/intent in extension `storage.local` and app secret store; presence memory-only/re-observed | pairing token never reaches content/page; “browser absent” and “one chat absent” are different facts |
| shared broken-page recovery | `bridge.ts` `activeUntil` + `repairsInFlight` + `unattributedIncident` + `goalWatch` | **process memory**, not a recovery WAL; handout tokens/cooldowns/episode ids are ephemeral and re-earned from live evidence | restart must not resurrect an old browser action merely because it was once queued. A durable Goal reply obligation is separate truth and may cause a new Goal watch after this run observes/accepts eligible work; the old repair token itself never survives as authority |
| browser observation custody | `extension/background.js` journal | `storage.session` until app `/events` accepts it | content-script success means “journal owns it”, not “app stored it”; an acknowledged observation must never vanish on worker suspension |
| real conversation lifetime in a tab | `extension/background.js` tab registry | `storage.session` | document reload/pagehide is not conversation close; tab removal/navigation away decides closure |
| active agent tab discard policy | `agents.ts` live state projected by `bridge.ts`; applied by `extension/background.js` | exact conversation ids derived per `/status`; extension-owned tab ids in `storage.session` | active Prime and active/waking/detached Worker tabs are non-auto-discardable; sleeping/terminal chats restore only policy this extension changed |
| browser document + navigation identity | `background.js` document/epoch registry + `content.js` epoch | browser-session state + per-document memory | stale documents/epochs may observe but may not mutate current conversation state |
| browser command intent | `bridge.ts` `CommandSpec` | durable `bridge-commands` snapshot | exactly three semantic intents: fresh worker, exact-chat revive, fresh resume; the spec owns identity, not a URL/tab/document |
| browser command lease | `bridge.ts` command record | durable queued/leased phase including `claimedAt` + exact `owner`; restore preserves a valid leased owner | `/commands/redeem` is the arbitration cut; worker/revive are exclusive to that page owner. Resume alone may transfer a pre-dispatch lease to another destination document while its durable send checkpoint still proves nothing was dispatched |
| irreversible browser command result | `background.js` command ACK outbox → `bridge.ts` command/receipt semantics | ACK outbox is mirrored to `storage.local` for browser-restart durability; app command/receipt state survives app restart | fresh worker/resume terminal ACK retires into a receipt. A revive `sent` ACK proves the user message crossed ChatGPT, but the command intentionally stays leased until exact worker liveness or the 30s revival deadline resolves broker state |
| deferred worker revival | `background.js::deferredRevivals` | `storage.local` marker only | survives browser restart; actual prime text stays app-side; bridge redeem remains the authority, so stale markers are harmless |
| worker lifecycle + ownership | `agents.ts` | swarm snapshot + retained/dormant prime-owned history | conversation binding is identity; `invited/active/detached/waking/sleeping/finished/failed` describe broker state, not page decoration |
| worker slot accounting | `agents.ts::occupiesSlot` | derived from broker state | sleeping workers free slots; waking reserves one before the browser acts; terminal rows never revive |
| agent message delivery | `agents.ts` | durable broker queue | at-least-once until authenticated acknowledgement; `offered` is not `delivered`; revival-delivered user messages are never re-offered in tool results |
| per-chat workspace | `workspace.ts` | memory derived/learned from proven identity + roots, moved with ownership | convenience state only; never authorization; missing trustworthy workspace fails instead of choosing the first root |
| exec session custody | `codex/ownership.ts` + singleton manager | process lifetime | running or exited-unread process id belongs to the proven durable local session principal; A→B keeps custody without adoption, while another session/worker cannot poll or write it |
| background exec obligations | `codex/ownership.ts::backgroundExecObligations` + `UnifiedExecProcessManager::backgroundState` | retained process rows until the owner reads/releases them | completed unread output is data owed to that durable session, never GC fodder; four unread completed results block that session from spawning another child before any process is started |
| Compact & Resume transaction | `session/continuation.ts` | durable continuation WAL + session metadata commit | one local session, one open continuation per session, one claimant/commit; source keeps ownership until durable rebind lands |
| source/destination send ambiguity | continuation send checkpoints | durable `not-attempted` / `attempted-unresolved` / `dispatched-unresolved` / resolved message identity | pre-dispatch ambiguity is replayable; post-dispatch ambiguity is **not** permission to click again; ChatGPT's marked message resolves it |
| resume shadow suppression | `session/resume-gate.ts` | short memory claim bounded to 60s | recorder waits briefly for the already-authoritative continuation instead of inventing a second local session for the replacement chat |
| resumed first-answer Goal provenance | `content.js` `resumeGoalPending` / `maybeRecoverResumeGoalTurn()` | tab-local `sessionStorage` (`clf-resume-goal-v1`) + live memory only | armed only by this document's real resume bootstrap plus acknowledged A→B continuation; waits for B's post-commit Goal policy, can recover exactly that one completed first answer, then is consumed. It is provenance for the page trigger, never continuation/session/Goal authority |
| Goal objective | `goal.ts` objective ledger | durable per-conversation named state | chat-local finish line; moved by Compact & Resume; restore alone never starts work |
| Goal / Loop chat switch | `goal.ts` `goal-switches` ledger | durable per-conversation `{enabled, mode, at}`, bounded to 400 decisions; absence inherits app-wide config | exact-chat stop/mode choice survives reload/restart and moves with Compact & Resume; an existing row outranks ordinary app-wide changes. Deliberate app-wide **On→Off** is the master stop and clears all rows, so a later global On again reaches chats whose overrides were intentionally discarded |
| Goal terminal reply obligation | `goal.ts` reply ledger | durable, one row per conversation, TTL + cap | the recorder freezes whether a stable final reply still requires one Goal decision before page races/reloads can lose it |
| Goal draft | `goal.ts` draft map | memory; tied to durable obligation | at most one draft per conversation/turn; browser client owns acknowledgement; only `ready` text may be typed and `no-reply` is a real terminal decision |
| renderer authority | `ipc.ts` + preload allowlist | process lifetime | renderer never receives generic Node/invoke authority; async reads paint only when their selection/generation still matches |
| connection/tunnel generation | `connection.ts` + `tunnel/*` | process lifetime, re-observed from process/metrics | stale callbacks from replaced tunnels are ignored; `/readyz` + readable poll metrics establish runtime readiness, while a completed/fresh poll timestamp separately verifies external-link age and detects later loss |
| child process environment | `env.ts` | rebuilt per child | Windows env names are case-insensitive; never write `PATH` by raw object indexing; preserve the inherited environment unless a narrow repair is proven |
| Windows build-tool discovery | `toolchain.ts` | process memoization | fill missing/unreachable JAVA_HOME/GOROOT only; never override an explicit or already-reachable toolchain |
| shell compatibility repair | `exec-hints.ts` | per command | rewrite only when intent is provable; unsupported/ambiguous shell syntax passes through untouched; hints are preferred to semantic guessing |
| command output budget | `head-tail-buffer.ts` + `truncate.ts` + `exec-output.ts` | per process/result | collection cap and model-visible truncation are different bounds; preserve head+tail and explicitly count omitted middle bytes/tokens |
| Desktop frame/ref identity | `computer/index.ts` | bounded process caches | physical coordinates are meaningful only against the captured frame/window geometry; semantic refs are meaningful only against their UIA snapshot |
| extension install path | `extension-path.ts` | stable `userData/extension` for packaged builds | stage/fingerprint/rename/rollback; Chrome never points at an AppImage's temporary mount or a half-copied update |
| app update | `update.ts` | startup + unreferenced six-hour checks, one in-flight pass; versioned verified artifacts under `userData/updates` | Restart adopts an existing file only after a fresh published-digest check. Changed release selection retires old staged authority. Quit rechecks bytes before handoff; explicit Install requests relaunch. |
| tunnel-client run ownership | `tunnel/index.ts::ClientRun` + `current` | one process-generation object at a time; old child may exist only while `retirement` joins its teardown | every callback checks `current === run`; `restart()` is the CAS-like ownership cut, clears current before retirement, and only the retirement owner may schedule the successor |
| app-window lifetime | `window-lifecycle.ts` | process lifetime | only the single-instance lock owner touches shared userData; activation is gated until bootstrap/security/IPC are ready and permanently disabled once quit begins |

If two rows appear to own the same semantic decision, treat that as an architecture bug until
proved otherwise. Mirrored **presentation** is fine; mirrored **authority** is not.

**What “durable” means here.** `durable.ts` is the app's process/crash/restart transaction layer,
not a claim of database-grade fsync/power-loss durability. Named state writes are serialized,
generation-fenced and published by temp-file→rename; `writeDurableNow()` is the barrier used when a
later side effect must not happen until the control intent is on disk. A failed background write
stays pending/retryable and cannot poison the serialization chain for other names. But
`readDurable()` deliberately turns a missing, unreadable or unparsable control file into `null`
after logging it: corrupt auxiliary state may cost pending orchestration work, **never the app's
ability to start**. If a mechanism needs stronger recovery than that, its independently durable
source (for example session metadata/history) must be able to reconstruct the projection.

### 4.2 Runtime jump points — open the owner, not the symptom

This is the shortest path from a production symptom to the state machine that owns it. The
subsystem sections below explain the invariants; this table answers **which function do I open
first?**

| Mechanism | Start here | Then follow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| app bootstrap / restart order | `index.ts` `app.whenReady().then(...)` | Goal/correlation restore → retired workers/swarm → continuations → IPC/window → bridge/retention/connection/update; quit starts at the `will-quit` handler and enters `shutdown.ts` |
| MCP request identity | ingress: `mcp/inbound.ts::requestIdFromHeader()` → `kernel.ts::callerConversation()` / `recorder.ts::awaitFreshCallOrigin()`; browser proof publication: `recorder.ts::noteCallEvidence()` | `correlation.ts::observeRequestCorrelations()` writes exact URL/Fiber-agreed ownership; `requestCorrelation()` is then read by caller/workspace guards → `recordToolCall()`. The MCP request never creates its own ownership proof |
| live browser request-id ownership handshake | `content.js::confirmLiveRequestOwners()` | background `correlate()` → bridge POST `/correlations` → recorder exact call evidence → correlation registry read-back/`confirmed[]` |
| broken ChatGPT page auto-recovery | all evidence converges on `bridge.ts::queueBrowserRecovery()` | silence: `armSilenceSweep()` → `inspectSilentChats()`; assistant-error: `noteRecoveryObservations()`; unattributed: `noteCallAttribution(null)` → `repairUnattributedChat()`; no-tab: `queueMissingTab()`; Goal: `inspectOwedGoals()` → current `takePendingRepair()` → `background.js::maintain()` → `confirmRepair()` / `failRepairAttempt()` |
| Goal / Loop after a final answer | bridge POST `/events` durable `acceptGoalReplyNow()` + `content.js::noteGoalTurn()` | `watchGoalTurn()` → `/goal/draft` → `goal.ts::startGoalDraft(...deferStart:true)` → `beginGoalDraft()` / `requestDrivingDecision()` → `content.js::maybeSendGoalReply()` |
| automatic compaction | bridge `considerAutomaticCompaction()` (from `grantActivity()`): `store.ts::autoCompactionReady()` + `chatIsWorking()` + worker/blocked fence → `continuation.ts::openContinuationNow(automatic)` | page reads the ticket as `job` → `content.js::maybeResumePendingCompaction()` (raises its tab) → `startCompact()` → `stopAndSettle()` → bridge `/compact`; pickups by phase in `inspectOwedCompactions()`: asking 2 min × 5 then abort, writing 5 min × 3, opening 15 min × 3, each in front |
| Compact & Resume restart recovery | `continuation.ts::restoreContinuations()` | session metadata ownership → `commitContinuationResult()`/projection repair; browser send ambiguity is resolved by the continuation's durable source/destination send checkpoints |
| resumed first answer missed by Goal | `content.js::rememberResumeGoalPending()` / `bindResumeGoalTurn()` | `maybeRecoverResumeGoalTurn()` → exact single resume-user-turn + final/Fiber proof → ordinary `noteGoalTurn()`; synthetic `g-resume-<commandId>` is only a stable local turn id when no observed generation id exists |
| worker lifecycle | `tools-core.ts` `agents` action dispatch | `agents.ts::stageSpawn()` / `stageMessages()` / `stageFinishAgent()` → `persistCriticalSwarmNow()` → staged commit/rollback → bridge worker/revive commands → `background.js::recoverDeferredRevivals()` → exact page liveness back into `agents.ts` |
| browser command delivery | worker producers `bridge.ts::queueWorkerBootstrap()` / `queueWorkerRevival()`; **resume production** is bridge POST `/compact` after `continuation.ts::attachSummary()` → private `queueResumeCommand()` | durable command owner/lease → `/commands/redeem` / `/commands/ack` → `background.js::redeemCommand()` / `ackCommand()` → content send → receipt/recovery in `restoreCommands()`; exported `queueResume()` is a test/older-caller convenience wrapper, and private generic `queue()` is storage plumbing — neither is the semantic resume entrypoint |
| which browser opens a fresh chat | `bridge.ts::offerPlacement()` / `pendingBrowserPlacement()` → `background.js::placeSuccessorChat()` | the `/compact` reply that produced the command carries `placement`, and chat A's own browser creates chat B in chat A's window; `pendingBrowserPlacement()` spends opening authority on handout, before hydration; no timer may issue a second OS open. `openFreshChatInBrowser()` handles a resume with no waiting browser collector |
| extension document/conversation identity | `background.js::authorizeDocument()` / `registerDocument()` / `ownsDocument()` | `noteTabConversation()` + `chatgpt-dom.js::conversationFromPath()` / `conversationId()`; React-only evidence begins at `fiber.js::scan()` |
| page observation commit | bridge POST `/events` | exact lost-worker-ACK recovery + `noteAgentAlive()` → `recorder.ts::recordChatObservations()` → durable Goal reply obligation → browser-recovery activity → context ceiling → staged/durable worker final → HTTP 200 lets extension journal retire the batch |
| Overwrite / native ChatGPT presentation | `content.js::renderStreams()` | `websiteRenderForTurn()` + `completeReplacementForTurn()` + `hasUnrepresentedFiberCall()` → `chatgpt-dom.js::replaceActivity()` / `hideProgress()`; exact Fiber/page identities decide whether local activity is complete enough to replace native activity, while ChatGPT always keeps answer/code/actions |
| session evidence / mutable website messages | `store.ts::appendEvent()` / `upsertMessageEvent()` | `recorder.ts` attribution/repair → canonical message shards + rebuildable `meta.json` projection |
| background terminal result custody | `codex/ownership.ts::backgroundExecObligations()` / exec-session owner map | `tools-core.ts::execSession()` resolves the durable local principal for admission → `UnifiedExecProcessManager::backgroundState()` → owner drains/releases via `write_stdin` |
| connector connect/disconnect/settings | `connection.ts::enqueueLifecycle()` | `connectImpl()` → Core MCP/tunnel → `startDesktopTunnel()`; settings enter `applySettingsImpl()`, ordinary stop enters `disconnectImpl()`, final stop enters `shutdownConnection()` |
| tunnel health / restart | `tunnel/index.ts::startOpenAiTunnel()` | `ClientRun` → `routeObservation()` → single-owner `restart()`; `connection.ts` and `diagnostics.ts` consume this report rather than supervising the child |
| app update | `update.ts::startUpdateChecks()` → `checkForUpdates()` | `runPass()` → `stagedArtifact()` (packaged installs only) → `download()` + SHA-256 publication → `applyStagedUpdate()` at ordered shutdown |
| Chats “Open Chat” | IPC `sessions:openChat` | re-read session truth → `browser.ts::openInPreferredBrowser(chatUrl(id))`; preload `openSessionChat()` is the narrow renderer boundary and `renderer/chat.ts::sessionRow()` is presentation only |

When a row crosses files, keep following the **same identity** through the arrows. Do not jump to a
later fallback/UI symptom merely because its function name contains the error the user saw.

---

## 5. Startup and shutdown — `index.ts`

```text
single-instance lock
  → only the lock owner may touch userData/bootstrap state
  → init config/secrets/session/durable paths → load + validate config
  → restore Goal objective → per-chat switch → reply-obligation ledgers
  → restore request correlations BEFORE bridge traffic can race in
  → wire recorder↔agent identity callbacks + preferred-browser opener
  → wire swarm persistence sinks even if multi-agent currently off
  → restore retired-worker fences → restore active+dormant swarm history
  → if feature is off: pause live execution, preserve history, persist the safe projection
  → restore continuations AFTER swarm, because recovery may need to repair prime ownership
  → install renderer CSP + deny browser permissions
  → register fixed IPC → enable the native window activation gate → create/show window + tray
  → queue legacy attribution repair asynchronously
  → start bridge if recording OR multi-agent
  → start session-retention maintenance independently of recording admission
  → auto-connect MCP/tunnel if configured
  → start non-blocking updater lifetime: immediate pass + unreferenced six-hour recheck schedule
```

`ui.chatBrowser` owns the Chrome/Edge choice for OS-originated ChatGPT launches. `browser.ts`
reads it at launch time and tries only that family's installations; failures propagate to the
request owner instead of opening the system default browser. The setting does not select a
profile or override connected-extension delivery/source-tab placement. Legacy configs use Chrome.

The **window activation gate** is a real lifetime boundary, not UI polish. Electron may deliver
`second-instance` after its own `ready` event while this app is still restoring durable state and
before CSP/permission/IPC setup is complete. `window-lifecycle.ts` therefore drops/folds early
focus requests until bootstrap enables the gate. Once `before-quit` disables it, that disable is
terminal: an old async startup continuation must never re-enable window creation during teardown.

The losing single-instance process also sets `quitting` immediately. `app.quit()` does not stop
module evaluation, so **every** shared-userData bootstrap path must be guarded by
`shouldBeginAppBootstrap()` rather than assuming a secondary process disappeared synchronously.

**Must hold.** The window keeps context isolation on, Node integration off, renderer
sandbox on, navigation and window creation constrained, permission requests denied unless
explicitly supported. Never weaken that to solve a renderer convenience problem. Every new
long-lived process, timer, listener, queue or durable writer names its shutdown owner —
teardown covers tunnels, both listeners, process sessions, then flushes session and durable state.

`will-quit` calls `preventDefault()` and owns the decision to quit from then on, and it
destroys the tray before teardown starts. So teardown is not merely ordered, it is **bounded**:
`shutdown.ts` gives each phase its own budget and always ends the process. A task that never
settles would otherwise strand an invisible main process holding the single-instance lock, and
every later launch of the app would silently do nothing. Per-task bounds are not a substitute
for that — "each piece is bounded" is a different claim from "the sequence ends".

Ending it is `app.exit(0)`, never `app.quit()`, and that is not interchangeable. Electron drops
a quit raised from the promise continuation that finishes teardown: on Windows the call returns
without even emitting `before-quit`, while the same call one macrotask later quits normally.
`shutdown.ts` therefore owns the exit itself rather than trusting its caller to remember.

The shutdown phases are also semantic ordering, not just cleanup aesthetics:

1. **admission/drain** — stop MCP + bridge from accepting work and let already accepted requests
   reach their own bounded drains;
2. **process cleanup** — only after request handlers stop may PTYs and the Windows helper be killed;
3. **recorder flush** — recorder work may enqueue session and named durable writes;
4. **durable flush** — session store and named-state store are independent writers and both get a
   last attempt even if one fails;
5. **update handoff** — a verified staged update is the final effect, after every stateful owner has
   finished, because the next process start is meant to be the new version.

### App update is deliberately boring — `update.ts`

There is no `electron-updater`, renderer-owned download state or forced restart. One deduplicated
`checkForUpdates()` pass runs after startup and nobody awaits it; `startUpdateChecks()` repeats it
on an unreferenced six-hour timer, because this app lives in the tray and "once per start" is in
practice "never" for an installation nobody restarts. A pass asks GitHub only for the newest tag,
decides whether this exact installation can self-apply an artifact, downloads at most that one
file, verifies it against the release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`, publishes it from `.part` by rename, and
waits for the user's ordinary quit. A repeat pass over an already staged release stops at the
release call.

The state machine is intentionally one record: `UpdateStatus {current, latest, stage, error,
checkedAt}` with `stage = idle|checking|downloading|ready|failed`. `checkedAt` is set the moment
the release API answers and is the *only* thing separating "checked, nothing to install" from "has
not asked yet" — both are `{latest: null, stage: 'idle'}` otherwise, and the UI may not claim the
first without it. `checkForUpdates()` owns one in-flight `pass` promise, so duplicate callers join
the same check/download. `stagedArtifact()` is the platform policy function and refuses an
unpackaged run outright — a dev tree is permanently "behind" and quitting `electron-vite dev` must
never run an installer over the maintainer's real install. `download()` is the checksum/publication
boundary; `applyStagedUpdate()` is the only installer/swap boundary. `onUpdateChange()` notifies
`ipc.ts`, which republishes the ordinary application state; `renderer/main.ts::updateSummary()`
turns that record plus the bridge's extension version into one sentence and one tone, which
`paintUpdate()` renders in three places and nowhere else: the header notice bar (only for what the
user can act on), the Activity panel's `#updateLine` (every state, green when current, red when a
check or download failed), and exactly one toast per window. The renderer never checks GitHub,
chooses assets, hashes bytes or decides install eligibility.

- Windows x64/ARM64 stages the matching NSIS installer and launches it detached with `/S` during
  shutdown; installer is per-user and needs no elevation.
- Linux **AppImage** can stage the matching AppImage; shutdown copies to `<running>.new`, chmods and
  renames over the path so the mounted old inode can finish running safely.
- Linux **DEB** is package-manager-owned; macOS has ad-hoc signing, not Developer ID notarization.
  Both may show a newer-version notice but do not silently self-replace.
- An unpackaged run (`npm run dev`, a working tree) is told what is published and stages nothing.
- A failed check/download leaves the running version fully usable and the next six-hour pass (or
  restart) checks again. Apply happens only inside ordinary shutdown: `applyStagedUpdate()` consumes
  the in-memory staged row before handoff, so an apply failure has no same-run retry and the next app
  start performs a fresh check. There is no retry state machine around either path.
- Update network waits are bounded at the owner: latest-release/checksum HTTP uses a 15-second
  ceiling, while the artifact download may take up to 10 minutes. Expiry is just a failed one-pass
  check/stage; it does not start a same-run retry daemon or force an app restart.
- Staged authority is process memory; the versioned artifact survives restart. The next pass asks
  for the release and its published checksum, then `adopt()` reuses a matching file without another
  download. A changed/withdrawn release retires the previous authority. Quit hashes the artifact
  again before execution; a directory containing an executable alone never grants install authority.
- Explicit Install uses the ordinary drained shutdown and requests relaunch (`--force-run` on
  Windows, `app.relaunch` for AppImage); an ordinary quit does not reopen the app. Recheck UI stays
  in Checking, never briefly claims a manual update. A release must be strictly newer than the
  installed version; replacing bytes under the same tag cannot trigger an upgrade.

The update module does **not** own extension-version truth. `bridgeStatus()` learns that from the
authenticated extension header; duplicating it in the updater would create two authorities.

## 6. MCP surfaces and discovery — `surfaces.ts`, `tools.ts`, `server.ts`

**Full prompt delivery:** MCP initialize.instructions remains advertised, but host projection
does not prove that the model received it. App-authored input freezes the complete current Core
instructions in its existing durable deliveryText before handout (IPC prepareText + input.ts).
The same formatter prefixes the pre-summary request and browser-redeemed worker/resume/revival
commands. Shared `user-prompt.ts` frames the full text without shortening it; existing continuation
markers stay first. The renderer and extension hide only that framed prefix. Native message bytes,
recording, token accounting and exact Send receipts remain complete. Direct user sends in Chrome
are not intercepted. Internal planner/decision prompts retain their separate role-specific contract.
Goal/Loop reference history uses authored user text rather than the executor's instruction envelope.
Native user bubbles can consume Markdown bytes even inside `whitespace-pre-wrap`. Receipts,
recording and presentation share the exact native message source through `userMessageSource()`;
the mounted conversation's read-only `serverId$` signal supplies its durable identity, while its
`WEB:` local id supplies no chat ownership. Conflicting durable IDs remain rejected. The display
uses strict framing on original text and preserves the native DOM and controls. `COS_CONTEXT` is length-delimited
transport framing, not chat identity. Core guidance starts directly with the coding instructions;
one sentence under Local tools describes the connectors without a setup URL or app-ID lookup.
Do not add an instructions tool or a per-chat "prompt sent" flag alongside these delivery owners.

**Code mode** (`docs/code-mode.md`): every populated surface adds `exec({code})` alongside its
direct tools. MCP requires object arguments and the host owns the outer namespace; inside the
code, `tools.<name>(args)`, top-level await, Promise.all, text and image provide Codex-style
composition. Exact request/conversation/durable-session identity is required before evaluation.
QuickJS runs inside a disposable bounded worker with no ambient host APIs. Children reuse the
same registrar/schema/handler and dispatcher with fresh evidence, inherited caller proof and a
fresh live permission/root projection. Plugins still use their manager and redact generated
outer output. Only explicit emissions enter the model result; individual children remain recorded.
Only the outer call owns input/inbox delivery. Finish signals stay direct. Runtime termination
closes new admission; accepted actions retain their normal execution/recording lifetime. Limits
live only in `CODE_MODE_LIMITS`; do not add another executor, identity registry or delivery queue.

ChatGPT discovers **one server's entire tool list as a unit**: a no-query
`list_resources` returns every schema that server advertises. Splitting into separate
servers is therefore the only mechanism that actually bounds the worst case. Core and Desktop
retain their existing contracts. The optional Plugins surface publishes external MCP tools.

**Core** (`chat-on-steroids-core`, required):

| Tool | Live when | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | `read` \| `browse` \| `metadata` | `tools-core.ts` → `codex/read-backend.ts` |
| `view_image` | `read` | `tools-core.ts` → `codex/view-image.ts` |
| `find` | `search` **and not** `command` | `tools-core.ts` → `search.ts` |
| `apply_patch` | any of `create`/`edit`/`move`/`deleteFile` | `codex/apply-patch/*` |
| `exec_command`, `write_stdin` | `command` | `codex/unified-exec.ts` |
| `download_artifact` | `saveArtifact` | `tools-core.ts` → `artifact-fetch.ts` + `artifact-target.ts` |
| `session` | recording enabled | session subsystem |
| `agents` | multi-agent enabled | `agents.ts` |

**Desktop** (`chat-on-steroids-desktop`, optional, **Windows/macOS**): `observe` needs `screen`;
`computer` registers on `control` **or** either clipboard permission, then re-checks each
of its 13 actions at runtime. The surface is offered at all only when one of those four
permissions exists on a supported host — an empty or impossible connector is worse than no connector.

**Plugins** (`chat-on-steroids-plugins`, optional): `plugins/manager.ts` owns installed external
stdio/Streamable HTTP servers and enabled tools. `mcp/tools-plugins.ts` preserves upstream JSON
schemas/results through the SDK and existing attribution/recording dispatcher. Installation and
credentials stay in the main process; external processes do not inherit the CoS folder sandbox.
Discovery is bounded to 64 tools / 250 KB. Stale calls check live plugin policy. See `docs/plugins.md`.
Static Core/Desktop/session declarations and JSON conversions are cached; SDK server instances
and handler closures stay per request. Plugin exposure is invalidated at publication/revocation
before async work can yield. The manager sanitizes external results once; the dispatcher sanitizes
only appended inbox/input/recovery content and records the same final object that it returns.
Official npm Playwright launches default `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CODEGEN=none` through its upstream
response policy; explicit launch/configuration still takes precedence. `redaction.ts` masks
recognizable sk-prefixed credentials in authored plugin output and recorded tool arguments/results,
including overflow assets. Invocation inputs and opaque image bytes keep their original values.
Only installed and enabled plugins own a running connection; no catalog recipe is preinstalled.
Enabled connections restore in the background on app startup and remain alive until disabled,
uninstalled, failed, restarted or app shutdown. Tool inactivity does not retire their process state.
OAuth remotes use `plugins/oauth.ts` with the MCP SDK for discovery, DCR, PKCE and refresh.
Credentials are encrypted per installation and exact endpoint. Startup/reconnect may refresh saved
credentials but never open a browser or register a new client; explicit **Sign in** owns the bounded
loopback callback. Cancellation, replacement and shutdown revoke that flow. Unauthenticated cached
tools remain unpublished. Blender also requires the open editor and its running MCP addon.

**Core/Desktop exposure is monotonic per endpoint lifetime.** ChatGPT caches schemas, and yanking one
from under a cached snapshot surfaces as a transport-level UNKNOWN failure. So
`server.ts` remembers what this endpoint has ever exposed. A permission revoked after
exposure leaves the schema registered and its handler returns `TOOL_DISABLED`. The
`find`-vs-exec choice is frozen the same way, at first discovery.

**Must hold.** Two separate concepts, never collapsed: *exposed* (a schema may exist
because it was visible earlier) and *live* (the operation is allowed now).
**Schema visibility is never the security boundary** — `config.ts::effectiveCapabilities()`
and the live guards are. A server registers only tools its surface declares and answers
anything else with a protocol-level unknown-tool error; there is no merged list and no
hidden acceptance. A deliberate reconnect is the clean boundary for changing the shape.

**Tests.** `mcp.test.ts`, `config.test.ts`, `mcp-shutdown.test.ts`.

## 7. One MCP call, end to end

```text
tunnel request
 → server.ts    loopback Host/Origin, secret tokenized path, bounded body,
                x-request-id read + normalized (split before '/')
 → tools.ts     build only the requested surface
 → kernel.ts    AsyncLocalStorage call context
                resolve exact caller from correlation evidence
                resolve agent identity if a swarm is active
                wait for identity when the operation genuinely needs it
                enforce the live capability / read-only guard
 → tool handler sandbox any model path, execute, attach structured evidence
                (changes, counts, exit code, session id, assets)
 → recorder.ts  exact args/result/outcome; attach ONLY on proven ownership
 → kernel       agent inbox offer/ack bookkeeping
 → response
```

`server.ts` manually reads and bounds chunked / no-`Content-Length` POST bodies before
handing parsed JSON to the MCP adapter. **Do not regress that to a `Content-Length`-only
guard.** `inbound.ts` captures the raw header because the MCP library's higher-level
context has not reliably exposed it.

`call-context.ts` deliberately exposes **three lifetimes**, because "not completely accounted
for" is not the same as "can still mutate the machine":

- `runningToolCalls()` — dispatch has not returned; this is the **Compact & Resume safety
  barrier**, because commands/edits may still be changing the machine.
- `settlingToolCalls()` / `inFlightToolCalls()` — handler result is already released, but an
  unattributed durable record may still be waiting for late request-id evidence. Useful for
  diagnostics/shutdown/orphan accounting, **not** a reason to stall compaction for the recorder's
  grace window.
- `inFlightMcpRequests()` — widest request lifetime, including identity wait and durable recording;
  orphan cleanup uses it so post-handler bookkeeping never looks like global idleness.

An unresolved call is conservatively visible to every conversation until ownership lands; a
proven worker call does not block an unrelated prime.

Tool failure reporting has four semantic outcomes in `shared/session.ts::ToolOutcome`, and the
distinction feeds both UI tone and reliability metrics:

| Outcome | Meaning | Reliability defect? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | tool completed normally | no |
| `process_exit_nonzero` | the spawned program returned a real non-zero exit; the tool transport/runtime itself worked | no |
| `tool_rejected` | the app intentionally refused the operation (permission, validation, ownership, policy, etc.) | no |
| `tool_internal_error` | connector/tool implementation/runtime failed to perform its own contract | **yes** |

`call-context.ts::noteOutcome()` keeps the strongest/more-specific outcome so a generic wrapper
cannot overwrite a timeout/internal failure with a weaker classification. `noteExec()` classifies
ordinary non-zero child exits separately from tool timeouts, and `store.ts` increments the session
reliability numerator only for `tool_internal_error`. `normalizedToolOutcome()` preserves the
self-proving legacy rows without guessing ambiguous old `error` records. Do not collapse these back
to success/error: a broken build is not proof the connector is unreliable, and a policy rejection
is not a tool crash.

## 8. Filesystem containment — `sandbox.ts`

The authority for every model-supplied path. Approved folders get virtual roots such as
`/project`; native absolute paths are also accepted when they resolve inside an approved root.

The **root name does not mean “this is the repository”**. Users commonly approve a parent folder
that contains several projects, so a live root like `/workspace` says only which folder was
approved. The model-visible `read` description deliberately gives the live root names but invents
no suffix such as `/workspace/src/main.ts`; it tells the caller to name every real folder between
the approved root and the file, using the same project-relative shape it would pass as
`exec_command.workdir`. Reading the root itself is the discovery primitive: it lists one level
deep. Do not reintroduce worked paths that silently promise the approved root is the project.

**Must hold.**

- Every model filesystem path converges on `Sandbox.resolve()` or an already-validated
  wrapper. "It is only a read" is not an exemption — reads are confidentiality-sensitive.
- **Virtual and native spellings receive identical authorization.** Test both the virtual
  spelling and the host spelling (`C:\approved\project\src\a.ts` on Windows,
  `/home/me/project/src/a.ts` or `/Users/me/project/src/a.ts` on POSIX). Never "improve" native
  normalization by letting it collapse traversal the virtual spelling rejects.
- Containment covers root selection, host-invalid/path-trick rejection, canonical checks on
  existing targets, deepest-existing-ancestor validation for missing targets, reserved virtual
  root names, and symlink/reparse/junction handling as applicable to that OS.
- Authorization must remain valid at the point of filesystem use; avoid designs that rely
  only on an earlier pathname check when the underlying target can change.
- Native filesystem error text must not leak hidden physical root paths back to the model.

**Not contained: shell commands.** `exec_command` is arbitrary code execution as the
logged-in user. Its *starting cwd* is restricted to an approved folder; the command is not.
That is why `command` is the strongest permission and why read-only mode disables it
outright. Never claim approved roots contain arbitrary commands — they contain the app's
filesystem tools. Read-only derives from the complete write-capability list, so a new write
capability must become read-only-blocked automatically.

**Tests.** `sandbox.test.ts`, plus retained bughunt repros.

## 9. Workspaces — `workspace.ts`

Two ideas that are easy to confuse: **approved roots** are the security boundary the user
configured; a **workspace** is convenience state saying which project *this exact chat or
agent* is working in.

Keyed by exact chat/agent identity, learned from proven absolute paths and project markers,
inherited by spawned workers, moved by Compact & Resume.

**Must hold.** A relative path or omitted `workdir` with no trustworthy workspace **fails**
rather than mutating a guessed project. When caller identity is unresolved during a swarm,
never silently fall back to the first approved root — that turns an attribution failure
into a wrong-target mutation. Moving a workspace is state continuity, never a new
permission; the target still has to be legal.

**Tests.** `workspace.test.ts`, `swarm.test.ts`.

## 10. The Codex-derived tools — `src/main/codex/*`

Selected public Codex behavior ported into TypeScript. **It does not launch a Codex model
or require a Codex installation.**

**`exec_command` / `write_stdin`.** `unified-exec.ts` ports session ids, output draining,
head/tail buffering, yield deadlines, output token policy, interactive stdin, and sessions
that outlive the call that created them. Windows adaptations (quoting, interrupt) live
beside the port and stay explicit and tested against model-facing behavior. There is a
known Ctrl+C vs. natural-exit race worth keeping a regression for. The local MCP adaptation
also accepts `cmds` to run related commands sequentially in one labeled shell session, and an
empty `write_stdin` poll returns on first output instead of holding Codex's full collection
window. Start at `tools-core.ts`
→ `unified-exec.ts` → `shell.ts` → `ownership.ts` → `exec-output.ts`.

The local execution wrapper adds several mechanisms around that port. They are not generic
"helpfulness" and must stay fail-safe:

- **One process manager, app lifetime.** `codex/manager.ts` is the singleton that makes an exec
  session id meaningful across later `write_stdin` calls. Never create a second manager per tool
  registration or conversation; caller isolation is enforced by `ownership.ts`, not by separate
  process pools.
- **One OS-correct child environment.** Every spawned process converges on `env.ts`. Windows
  environment keys are case-insensitive even though JavaScript object keys are not, so raw
  `env.PATH = ...` beside an inherited `Path` can erase the user's real PATH when CreateProcess
  folds the two spellings together. Read/write through `envValue`/`setEnvValue`, normalize before
  spawn, and only append the minimal Windows system directories when the inherited path is truly
  unusable.
- **Toolchain repair fills; it never chooses for the user.** `toolchain.ts` looks for a Windows JDK
  or Go installation only when `JAVA_HOME`/`GOROOT` is absent **and** the corresponding executable
  is unreachable. Java proves `javac.exe`, not merely `java.exe`, so a JRE cannot become a fake
  build JDK. Discovery is process-memoized because it sits on every command path.
- **Shell compatibility is abstention-first.** `exec-hints.ts` may repair a narrowly proven
  PowerShell quoting/glob mismatch, classify a documented search exit-1 as "no matches", or add an
  actionable recovery hint. If tokenization/flag arity/control flow is ambiguous, the original
  command runs untouched. A guessed rewrite that succeeds at the wrong command is worse than a
  visible failure.
  - PowerShell native-program glob expansion is deliberately bounded by the **actual command-line
    constraint**, not by what makes a readable note. One proven relative directory may expand to at
    most 128 names; the command receives every name, while `listExpandedNames()` shows only the
    first 12 plus a count. Above the bound the command is left untouched — silently searching a
    shortened list would be a wrong answer. Globs after a prior statement are not expanded because
    that statement may have changed cwd; textual brace expansion has no such cwd dependency.
  - Exit 1 is classified benign only for a search whose status semantics are proved. Bare ripgrep
    still needs the existing executable/path proof; `git grep` is separately understood because
    this runtime launches PowerShell with `-NoProfile` and can safely identify `git` plus the exact
    `grep` subcommand. Predicate flags such as `--quiet`/`--exit-code`, ambiguous global git options
    (`git -C …`), a status-deciding later pipeline stage, or `fatal:`/`error:` output withhold the
    exemption. `git diff`/`apply`/`push` exit 1 remains a real non-zero process result. This is
    classification, never permission to rewrite a failing git command into success.
- **`cmds` is one shell, not N processes.** `command-batch.ts` composes sequential commands in the
  same shell so cwd/environment changes survive between them. It keeps running after ordinary
  non-zero exits, frames each section with a random marker that command output cannot spoof by
  accident, and returns the first non-zero exit after all sections ran. Recovery hints consume
  only completed nonzero sections and name that command: a later parse failure must not imply
  earlier commands did not run or invite repeating their successful mutations.
- **Collection and model output are different budgets.** `head-tail-buffer.ts` bounds what a
  process can accumulate while keeping a stable head, rolling tail and exact omitted-byte count.
  `truncate.ts`/`exec-output.ts` separately bound what is serialized to the model in UTF-8 byte /
  approximate-token space. Do not collapse the collection ceiling into the default response
  budget. The connector accepts legacy `max_output_tokens` values but enforces its fixed response
  ceiling, without adding a migration note to every result. Command batches keep their random
  delimiter internal: `composeCommandBatch()` hands the exact marker to both the raw section parser
  and `CommandBatchDisplay`. Only batches allocate a second bounded head/tail stream for presentation;
  nonce removal occurs on incoming bytes before collection/truncation and survives poll boundaries.
  Text and structured output share that projection; command numbers and exit codes remain visible.
- **A finished background command still owns an unread result.** `UnifiedExecProcessManager` no
  longer evicts exited sessions to make room. `backgroundState()` projects the caller-owned
  `running` and `exitedUnread` rows, and `ownership.ts::backgroundExecObligations()` is the one
  caller-scoped view used by notices and admission. Before `exec_command` allocates or spawns
  anything, `tools-core.ts::execConversation()` resolves the exact conversation once and refuses a
  fifth unread completed result with `EXEC_RESULTS_UNREAD`; the user/model must drain those exact
  session ids through `write_stdin`. Capacity is therefore **admission, not garbage collection**:
  never recover room by deleting output the owning conversation has not observed.
- **A still-running background command gets one caller-scoped attendance reminder, not a watchdog.**
  `ownership.ts::noteExecOwner()` starts its attendance clock and `noteExecAttended()` refreshes it
  around `write_stdin`; after `UNATTENDED_EXEC_NOTICE_MS = 120s`,
  `backgroundExecRecoveryNotices()` may append one "running unpolled" reminder for that exact owned
  session to the next MCP result delivered to the same durable session. `kernel.ts::
  withBackgroundExecRecovery()` is the single consuming path — merely inspecting runtime state must
  not spend the notice. A live dev server/tail does **not** consume the four-result unread admission
  budget and is never killed or auto-polled by this mechanism. A distinct authenticated request
  started after a notice was offered acknowledges that prose; same-request retries and older
  concurrent calls reoffer it. A later exit owns a fresh notice under the same receipt rule.
  Acknowledging either notice never drains output or releases the unread-result admission fence.

**`apply_patch`.** Model syntax is Codex V4A. MCP cannot expose a true freeform tool, so
the raw patch rides inside the `patch` string while the grammar lives in the description.
Engine under `apply-patch/`; the wrapper adds capability checks (per hunk kind — add needs
`create`, delete needs `deleteFile`, content change needs `edit`, rename needs `move`),
sandbox resolution, workspace behavior, recorder evidence. **Shell interception** also
exists so a model emitting `apply_patch` as a shell command still reaches the port — if the
failure involves `cd`, quoting, `&&` or other control flow, the bug is above the parser.

Multi-file patch failure has a concurrency fence: the wrapper snapshots bounded pre-edit state,
and rollback restores only paths that still match the state **this patch itself produced**. If an
external editor changed a path after the partial patch, rollback refuses to clobber that newer
work. The rollback budget is intentionally bounded; this is a recovery guarantee, not permission
to snapshot arbitrarily large repositories into memory.

Inside `codex/apply-patch/`, keep the layers distinct:

| File | Mechanism it owns |
| --- | --- |
| `parser.ts` | whole-input boundaries and the intentionally lenient heredoc wrapper; normalizes Rust `lines()` CRLF/trailing-newline behavior before handing text to the grammar engine |
| `streaming-parser.ts` | the actual V4A grammar state machine: begin/end markers, optional environment id, add/delete/update/move hunks, change-context/chunk construction, line-numbered parse failures |
| `hunk.ts` | immutable semantic hunk/chunk shapes and marker constants; path spelling is preserved for summaries while source resolution is a separate operation |
| `seek-sequence.ts` | ordered context search: exact → trailing-whitespace-insensitive → trim-insensitive → limited Unicode punctuation/space normalization; EOF hunks prefer the actual file end |
| `file-update.ts` | turns ordered chunks into non-overlapping replacements, including repeated updates to one file; replacements apply from the end so earlier edits cannot shift later indices |
| `text-file.ts` | line-ending-preserving source representation: untouched lines keep their exact CR/LF/CRLF, inserted lines use the file's first/preferred ending |
| `mode.ts` | explicit reconstruction policy (`normalize_to_lf` vs `preserve_line_endings`); upstream-compatible default is still normalization unless the caller opts into preservation |
| `errors.ts` | typed parse/I/O/replacement/path/implicit-invocation failures whose model-visible strings intentionally match upstream Codex behavior |

The fuzzy seek ladder is **matching policy, not authorization**. Paths are still sandboxed before
mutation, and a successful fuzzy content match never relaxes filesystem ownership or capability
checks.

**`read`.** Deliberately four layers: `tools-core.ts` owns the model contract and
multi-path behavior; `read-backend.ts` owns decoding/listing semantics; `filesystem.ts` is
primitives only; `sandbox.ts` is policy. **Do not push authorization down into
`filesystem.ts` and assume the public tool became safe.**

**`view_image`.** 8 MiB transport ceiling. PNG gets a real decode check; JPEG/GIF/WebP
validation has documented limits and does not yet match upstream's full-decoder guarantee.
Synchronous validation of an adversarial compressed payload is a main-process resource
risk. An invalid `image` content block can break an entire model turn — **prefer rejection
over optimistic decoding.**

**Tests.** `codex-runtime-parity`, `codex-apply-patch-parity`,
`codex-apply-patch-invocation-parity`, `codex-view-image-parity`, `mcp`.

## 11. Identity — the spine of the whole project

An MCP payload contains **no trustworthy ChatGPT conversation id**. There is exactly one
accepted proof chain:

```text
HTTP x-request-id                       (inbound.ts, normalized before '/')
  ≡ page message.metadata.request_id
  → fiber.js      emits allowlisted request evidence from the MAIN world
  → content.js    pins the concrete route + exact live page/Fiber owner
                 confirmLiveRequestOwners(requestIds, conversationId)
  → background.js correlate() re-checks current document/epoch + tab conversation
  → POST /correlations
  → bridge.ts     ensures/reuses that conversation session, files only unresolved exact ids,
                 then READS THE MAPPING BACK before ACK
  → correlation.ts  proves requestId → conversationId
  → consumed by: kernel · recorder · agents · workspace · terminal ownership
```

This acknowledged `/correlations` operation is deliberately **separate from transcript `/events`**.
Both routes publish exact evidence through `recorder.ts::recordRequestEvidence`, outside the
per-conversation transcript queue. Session initialization and historical lineage remain the one
owner; late proof for a retired source identifies that source so the normal superseded checks can
refuse it. Slow canonical text/image writes cannot delay the ownership acknowledgement.
A fresh ChatGPT chat can expose `metadata.request_id` while its newest React/Fiber turn still carries
a provisional client thread id, then converge on the real `/c/<conversation-id>` route shortly
after. For the one page turn this document locally owns, `content.js` may retain that provisional
Fiber descriptor long enough to send the pair `{concrete route conversationId, requestId}` through
`confirmLiveRequestOwners()`. Historical/mismatched Fiber objects get no such exception. The app
refuses any id already owned by another conversation, stores unresolved exact pairs through the
existing recorder/correlation path, and returns `confirmed[]`; the page marks an id app-confirmed
**only if that exact id comes back mapped to that exact conversation**. Batch `complete=false` does
not erase other individually confirmed ids. No tool name, current tab, clock or nearest-turn guess
is part of this handshake.

**Never substitute** active tab, timing, tool name, most-recent chat, only-generating chat,
worker payload, or arrival order. If proof is missing the safe state is **Unattributed**,
no workspace, or refusal for identity-sensitive work. Guessing is worse than losing
attribution: it routes commands, files, messages and history into the *wrong* chat.

`multiAgent.allowUnattributedCalls` relaxes only the **ambiguity fences**, not exact ownership.
Set to `false` — the migration baseline, and any install where the user turned it off —
`mcp/kernel.ts` refuses an unidentified call when a retired-worker lease
could own it, a dormant-worker lease could own it, or an active swarm needs exact workspace/terminal
identity. `needsWorkspaceIdentity()` makes relative `read`/`find`, every `apply_patch`, and
swarm/defaulted/relative `exec_command` identity-sensitive. Turning the setting on permits those
otherwise-unidentified calls to proceed, but an exact known `dormantWorker`, `retiredWorker` or
`endedWorker` is **still refused**. Do not document this as “disable attribution checks” or “all
unattributed calls run”: it changes what happens when identity is absent, never who owns a chat that
the app positively knows is a worker/fence.

This one chain explains symptoms that look unrelated — worker `WORKER_IDENTITY_LOST`, calls
piling into Unattributed, false worker stalls, wrong or absent project cwd, terminal
polling crossing chats, agent messages stopping, Overwrite having no local activity to
render. When several appear together, **debug the chain, not the symptoms**, in this order:

```text
server.ts/inbound.ts  did x-request-id arrive and normalize?
fiber.js              did the page model expose a matching metadata.request_id?
content.js            did refreshFiber accept the exact current descriptor and call
                      confirmLiveRequestOwners for the concrete route?
background.js         did correlate() still own that document/epoch and POST /correlations?
bridge.ts             did /correlations return this request id in confirmed[] for that chat?
correlation.ts        was requestId→conversationId stored, and restored after restart?
kernel.ts/recorder.ts did the call wait for, find and use the exact proof?
```

Agent routing is *downstream* of this. Do not start there.

`correlation.ts` is stricter than a cache and more bounded than a permanent database:

- the first exact proof for a request id wins; a later conversation claiming that id is refused
  without modifying or waking the original owner;
- the stored `sessionId` is the **local session epoch at first proof**, not merely the current
  conversation. A stale old page cannot drag an in-flight request into a newer local session epoch
  after Compact & Resume;
- proven owners have **no time TTL** and are reconciled from already-recorded request-id tool calls
  on startup, but the in-memory/durable registry is bounded to the **50,000 most recently observed
  request ids**. Do not describe it as literally unbounded/permanent storage;
- the durable snapshot is a fast index, not stronger than session history. Because its writes are
  debounced independently from attributed JSONL, startup reconciles recorded proof even when a
  non-empty snapshot already exists.

### 11.1 Block Chat — the one stop this app can make

A wedged ChatGPT page can leave a turn running with no working Stop control: the model keeps
issuing connector calls, the user cannot see the turn's messages and cannot cancel it, and every
one of those calls arrives here correctly attributed. **The app does not try to end that turn** —
nothing it can reach owns it. It owns whether the turn touches this machine, and refusing every
tool is enough: `kernel.ts` returns `BLOCKED_CHAT_REFUSAL` (`CHAT_BLOCKED: …`), which tells the
model to abandon the task, make no further tool calls and answer, so the turn ends itself.

`session/blocked-chats.ts` is a durable set of **conversation ids**, released only by the user.
Conversation, not request id, because `correlation.ts` already proves `requestId →
conversationId` and one ChatGPT turn issues all of its connector calls under one request id: a
list of request ids would ban the turn the user was looking at and nothing the same chat did a
second later.

- The refusal is the **first** branch of the dispatch chain in `kernel.ts::dispatchTracked`, above
  every worker-lifecycle verdict, and applies to every tool on every surface — `agents` finish
  included. A blocked chat has nothing left to finish.
- A blocked chat's **worker slot is released from the block itself.** `bridge.ts::sweepStaleSwarm()`
  sleeps every slot-holding worker (`occupiesSlot()`) whose conversation `isChatBlocked()`, on every
  30-second pass and once more immediately from `sessions:block`. It reads only the durable block:
  the silence grant it used to wait for is process memory, and a restart after the block left the
  restored worker `active` with no grant to expire, holding the swarm's one slot for an hour and
  refusing the next prime with `AGENTS_BUSY` (2026-09-02, worker-3). No browser recovery is ever
  attempted for a blocked chat; its recorded open turn stays open until real evidence ends it.
- It is **exact-identity only**, and never waits for evidence. It refuses a call whose *proven*
  owner is blocked and never one whose owner is merely unknown. That costs nothing: the user
  blocks a chat they can already watch making attributed calls, so its request id is proven and
  every later call in that turn resolves from the registry immediately. Do not "strengthen" this
  into blocking unattributed calls — that refuses an innocent chat's read to punish a different
  chat's turn.
- It survives restart, because the turn can. It is released by the user's own press, or by
  deleting the session whose row carries that button (`ipc.ts::sessions:delete`) — otherwise a
  block could outlive the only UI able to lift it.

Renderer: `chat.ts::sessionRow()` draws the toggle beside Open Chat, and `sessionBadges()` marks
the row `blocked`. The blocked set rides `sessions:list` as live policy — it is keyed by
conversation and must never be written into a session's `meta.json`. Preload exposes only
`setSessionBlocked(id, blocked)`; `ipc.ts` re-reads and validates that session's stored
conversation id, exactly as `sessions:openChat` does, so the renderer can never name a
conversation of its own.

**Tests.** `correlation.test.ts`, `mcp-inbound.test.ts`, `fiber.test.ts`,
`content-script.test.ts`, `swarm.test.ts`, `blocked-chats.test.ts`, `mcp.test.ts`
("blocked chats"), `ipc.test.ts`.

## 12. Session recording — `recorder.ts`, `store.ts`

Two independent producers, one durable timeline, neither replaceable by the other:

1. **MCP/app truth** — exact tool, arguments, result, outcome, file changes, duration, assets.
2. **Browser observation** — authored messages, turn lifecycle, native progress, visible
   errors, conversation identity, page request evidence.

The app knows *what the tool did*. The browser knows *which conversation and turn showed it*.

```text
userData/sessions/<id>/
  events.jsonl        append-oriented tool/turn/error/activity events
  messages/*.json     canonical user/assistant messages, one shard per logical id
  messages.json       legacy canonical map, read during lazy migration
  meta.json           atomically rewritten projection
  assets/<id>         screenshots and large/binary material
  handoffs/<id>.json  saved compaction briefs
```

**Must hold.** Streaming website messages are mutable snapshots of one logical message, so
Canonical message shards **replace by stable identity** — never turn that back into blind appends.
Structured activity stays append-oriented. Large values bound inline and spill to assets;
never fix a display-size problem by discarding the durable source. Durable state is the
authority across restart, and `meta.json` must never claim events that `events.jsonl` does
not contain. Unattributed is a **first-class state**, not a bug to paper over.

Distinct from `logger.ts`, which keeps a redacted operational ring and bounded asynchronous file
mirror. Final shutdown flushes the mirror; fatal failures use a separate bounded crash snapshot.

### The store has three write models, because the data has three different semantics

`store.ts` is not “JSON files on disk” in the abstract. It deliberately uses a different commit
mechanism for evidence, mutable website messages and derived metadata:

1. **Structured evidence — serialized append.** Each open session has one operation queue.
   Sequence assignment, complete JSONL append and in-memory projection update happen in that
   order on the queue; memory does not advance before the line exists. A crash-torn final line is
   detected/sealed before a later append so two JSON objects can never be concatenated into one
   apparently valid record. `events.jsonl` is therefore the history authority for structured
   activity, not `meta.json`.
2. **Canonical ChatGPT messages — atomic replacement by stable website identity.** Streaming and
   final revisions use one shard under `messages/`; the shard is temp→rename and a terminal final
   revision cannot later regress to streaming. Legacy append-only message snapshots remain readable
   but are suppressed when a canonical shard for that identity exists. Lazy migration overlays new
   shards on the old `messages.json` map rather than rewriting all history up front.
3. **`meta.json` — rebuildable projection.** Ordinary event ticks mark metadata dirty and coalesce
   rewrites; ownership/transaction boundaries that need a durable decision write it immediately.
   A validated `meta.backup.json` protects the last good checkpoint. On load, if metadata lags or is
   unusable, the store rebuilds history-derived counts/tokens/turn state from the journal + canonical
   messages while preserving metadata-only facts it can still trust. It refuses to turn an
   unrecoverable session into an invented empty one.

That distinction also explains why **per-session serialization** is enough for many reads/writes:
`flushSession(id)` joins only that session's queue rather than flushing every open session. A poll
of one chat must not force metadata rewrites for dozens of unrelated generating chats.
`readActivityEvents()` joins committed writes without flushing metadata. A reopened session hydrates
one bounded journal tail, then its existing append tail and canonical-message map serve cursor
pages and revisions. `tailFrom` describes proven journal coverage; an older canonical message
cannot lower that floor across missing journal rows. Resume boundaries use canonical origins.

Large data has bounds at every representation. Inline tool args/results are 8k chars; ordinary
assistant-message inline text is 12k, user messages may be much larger, and overflow text can spill
to a content-addressed asset up to the explicit overflow ceiling. Individual session assets are
limited to 8 MiB, with 192 MiB per-session and 2 GiB global asset quotas. Recent/tail readers have
their own row/byte ceilings. **A bound is part of the mechanism that owns that representation** —
raising a UI budget is not permission to remove the durable-store or transport bound underneath it.

### Attribution has one wait, then a first-class Unattributed landing

For a tool call that **has a request id** whose owner is not yet in the registry, `recorder.ts` waits
the current **20-second `REQUEST_ID_GRACE_MS`** for the browser's exact evidence. A headerless/no-id
call has no exact ownership proof to wait for and proceeds directly to the Unattributed verdict. The
grace does not delay unrelated chats: evidence waits open at admission, calls sharing one request
serialize in admission order, and each resolved session serializes preparation plus append.
Different workflows may resolve out of order; sequence numbers remain commit/cursor order and
existing turn chronology retains original call times. `pendingRecordings` accounts for every
admitted wait/write through shutdown. Already-proven calls await their own durable recording;
unidentified calls release the MCP response and remain charged to the settling counter.

If the exact proof still has not arrived, the call lands in the Unattributed session. That is a
durable truthful state, not a final guess. A later exact proof queues deterministic repair:

```text
scan bounded Unattributed source snapshot
 → group only calls whose own requestId now has exact proof
 → copy referenced assets first
 → append the same callId/evidence into the proved destination session epoch
 → rewrite only the scanned source prefix, preserving concurrent later appends
```

Mixed buckets are split call-by-call; timing, tool name, current tab and "only chat generating"
never participate. When correlation names an older `sessionId`, recorder searches that exact
conversation lineage historically and **refuses to downgrade into a newer owner** just because it
is easier to find.
Correlation snapshots materialize at the debounced write boundary. Restore and repair use the
existing uncapped session catalog. Late repair carries exact affected request ids; a bounded
derived bucket cache avoids rereading unchanged irrelevant history and is invalidated on rewrite.

One proven outcome is deliberately terminal in that stream: `superseded` means the request id
proved a conversation whose durable session attachment has already moved elsewhere. The proof is
kept on the call, but repair must leave it isolated; exact historical identity is not current
execution authority.

Browser observations serialize **per conversation**, not globally. Closing a browser conversation
also does not invent a turn ending: if durable metadata says a turn is still open, closure drops
the live page mapping and leaves turn recovery to the mechanism that can actually prove its
outcome. Reload recovery may synthesize a missing `turn_end` only against that durable open-turn
ledger, never merely because a content document disappeared.

The recovery proof is intentionally **state-based, not page-turn-id-based**. A reloaded page can
replay old final messages carrying historical turn ids, so `recorder.ts` scans for the newest final
assistant observation whose exact `turnId` is still present in the durable `openTurns` set and has
no explicit end in the same batch. Only that `recoveredFinal` may append a synthetic
`turn_end(completed)`. Other historical finals remain transcript backfill.

**A completed end the page reported is withdrawn by the server turn calling on.** ChatGPT's
request id is minted per server turn and outlives the page — reload, lost stream, Stop click. The
recorder remembers the request ids an open turn called under and, when the page reports that turn
`completed`, keeps them with the end. A call under one of those ids that *starts* after the
reported end (`reopenFalselyEndedTurn`) proves the end was the page's, not ChatGPT's: the recorder
appends an app-authored `turn_start` for the same id (with `detail`), takes the id out of
`knownTurnEnds` so the real end is accepted later, publishes it as `activeTurnId` again, and the
bridge retires whatever Goal was drafting for it (`retireGoalDraftsFor` + `forgetGoalWatch`). A call
that started before the end is an in-flight call finishing late and proves nothing; a different
request id is a different turn; only `completed` ends are reopened — a stop is the user's, the
failure outcomes belong to recovery. The proof is process memory: an app restart inside such a turn
leaves it closed as reported. Live 2026-09-02: a reload mid-turn closed the adopted turn after four
seconds, the same request id called tools for twenty-four more minutes, and Goal typed the next
message against an answer never given.

For Goal, a newer stable
final may also strengthen an earlier uncertain (`unknown|failed|interrupted|stalled`) turn boundary
when its authored time is at/after that turn's durable start; that marks the canonical assistant
message `goalEligible` **without fabricating another turn end**. Canonical message upsert keeps
`goalEligible=true` monotonic so a later sparse replay/503 cannot retract the durable Goal
obligation.

**Tests.** `session.test.ts`, `chronology.test.ts`, `resume.test.ts`.

### The model-facing `session` tool is a projection, not the store

`mcp/session-tool.ts` intentionally accepts an explicit `session_id`; it does **not** infer the
caller's current chat. Cross-chat recovery and observing a concurrently running worker are core
uses. The cursor is part of the data model:

- an initial read pins the maximum sequence observed as a snapshot;
- `older` and timeline continuation cursors keep that snapshot fixed, so later appends cannot
  reshuffle pages the model is already consuming;
- an `update_cursor` advances from `after` and carries up to four unfinished assistant
  `{id, chars, hash}` checkpoints. If the same message only grows, the next page returns the
  suffix; if its prefix changed, it says **ASSISTANT REPLACED** so the caller knows to discard
  the unfinished version it already read;
- `T…` tool-detail cursors pin sequence, offset and hash, so a changed detail fails as stale
  instead of splicing two different versions together;
- calls to `session` are still recorded for audit, but the session tool hides those self-reads
  from its own projection/search. Otherwise polling an update cursor would create an endless
  transcript of previous polls.

Result budgets reserve footer/cursor room **before** exact recorded text is appended. The final
bound check throws rather than cutting a cursor or silently shortening a user/assistant message.

**Retention is independent of recording admission.** `session/retention.ts` runs one prune at
startup and then a coarse six-hour sweep using the current `retainDays`. Turning recording off
does not exempt history already on disk from its retention policy.

## 13. The Chrome extension — `extension/*`

`manifest.json` is the composition root. It installs `background.js` as the MV3 **module service
worker**; injects `chatgpt-dom.js` then `content.js` plus `overlay.css` in the isolated world at
`document_idle`; injects `fiber.js` separately in the **MAIN** world; and points the toolbar action
at `popup.html`. Its only extension permissions are `storage`, `scripting` and `alarms`; host access
is ChatGPT plus the loopback bridge ports 8765–8769. When debugging “which context even loaded this
code?”, start here before reading runtime logic.

Three execution contexts with **three different lifetimes**:

| File | World / lifetime | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chatgpt-dom.js` | isolated, document | every selector and DOM-shape assumption |
| `content.js` | isolated, document | observation, turn lifecycle, Overwrite, compact UI |
| `fiber.js` | **MAIN**, document | React/Fiber evidence the DOM does not reveal |
| `background.js` | MV3 worker, **suspends freely** | bridge token, journal, tab↔conversation registry |

Plus `chrome.storage.session` — survives worker sleep, dies with the browser session — and
tab↔conversation binding, which follows tab lifetime and explicit navigation.

The service worker has several intentionally different durability classes; do not collapse them
into one "extension storage" bucket:

- **`storage.local`:** pairing port/token + explicit disconnect intent, `deferredRevivals`, and
  restart-surviving command-ACK recovery material. These are facts that may still matter after the
  whole browser restarts.
- **`storage.session`:** observation journal, close outbox, live tab/conversation/document state,
  and the command-ACK outbox used for MV3 worker suspension. These belong to the current browser
  session but must outlive a sleeping service worker.
- **content-script memory:** one document only — epoch, observers, seen identities, paint state,
  command attempt state. Reload destroys it by design.

`background.js::load()` is itself serialized by one `loading` promise. Cold-start races are normal
for MV3: two tabs must never independently restore an old storage snapshot and let the later load
overwrite an event the first caller already acknowledged.

The observation journal is **bounded but loss-accounting**, not infinitely durable. Current caps are
4,000 rows and roughly 4 MiB inside the extension's `storage.session` budget. Under pressure the
service worker first discards replaceable/nonessential progress, and if it must drop stronger
evidence it inserts an explicit same-route gap record. If Chrome refuses the journal write even
after compaction, the caller gets `durable:false` and a durability-gap `chat_error` is retained as
far as storage allows. Likewise, a batch leaves the journal only after the app returns success; an
irreducible malformed/oversize client batch becomes explicit gap evidence instead of a silent
splice in history. "Accepted by the extension" therefore means **either the observation or an
honest record of the gap remains under extension custody** — not that storage has infinite room.

Irreversible command ACKs outrank ordinary transcript draining for the same conversation. While a
send ACK is waiting in `commandAckOutbox`, `nextJournalBatch` will not let later observations from
that route overtake it. Otherwise the app could record the post-send assistant turn before it knew
the worker/resume user message had actually crossed its semantic boundary.
The journal has two transport slots and one in-flight batch per conversation. Fair selection
between batches prevents a hot chat monopolizing the transport; Goal joins its own transcript
delivery instead of another chat's stalled request. Retry/gap handling and journal custody remain
shared owners, with the original drain-level persistence cadence.

`commandAckOutbox` is also deliberately **browser-restart durable**. `persistLive()` mirrors the
bounded outbox to both `storage.session` and `storage.local`; `loadOnce()` prefers the local copy and
uses the session copy only as a migration fallback. `ackCommand()` inserts/replaces the command-id
row and awaits that persistence **before** trying the bridge network call. Therefore “ChatGPT
accepted this irreversible send” survives content-script death, MV3 suspension and a whole browser
restart; the retryable thing is only delivering the receipt to the app. Do not weaken this back to
session-only storage just because most other live tab state belongs to the browser session.

**`chatgpt-dom.js`** groups logical turns, extracts authored text, finds buttons/errors/tool
rows, and strips CLF-owned surfaces before reading so rendered replacements do not feed back
into recording. When ChatGPT changes markup, fix it here. **Never scatter emergency
selectors into `content.js`.**

**`content.js`** owns per-document memory: conversation epoch, seen-message identities, live
turn state, Fiber cache, rendered replacement state, pre-service-worker queue.

Conversation routing is not limited to `/c/<id>`. `chatgpt-dom.js::conversationFromPath()` /
`conversationId()` and `background.js::conversationFromUrl()` deliberately recognize the one
supported Project shape `/g/<project>/c/<id>` as the **same conversation id**. Every place that
asks "which chat is this?" must use those shared route rules; teaching only the recorder about a
Project URL while the service worker/recovery path still sees no conversation splits ownership.

Fiber conversation ownership includes the mounted `props.conversation.id` shape, alongside
the older direct conversation/client-thread fields. All observed IDs must agree. Helper
completion still requires its exact acknowledged user, current scan, terminal assistant ID
and bounded canonical raw text; missing identity is never replaced with rendered JSON.

Queued desktop inputs follow the durable local session across Compact & Resume. The outbox
publishes a superseded source ID only for still-queued input whose current session has moved.
The service worker may transfer that election to an existing successor tab once, persisting its
target conversation; it may not open a missing successor or replace a user-closed elected target.
Tab retirement protects that current queued-input owner. Already handed-out browser claims
continue protecting their exact original document until the send outcome is known.

**A turn opens from authored-user evidence, not from the Stop button.** A newly observed stable
ChatGPT **user** message opens one local generation and emits `turn_start`. On reload the content
script may adopt the durable `activeTurnId` the app already knows, but must not emit a second
start. Stop-button presence is downstream liveness evidence only: hydration/flicker/phase changes
must never manufacture a user turn.

Turn closing is deliberately asymmetric:

- manual Stop is `stopped` and is never upgraded into success;
- a visible error/interruption/stall keeps its exact non-success outcome;
- when Fiber is healthy, the current response's model-backed terminal/end-turn evidence is the
  strongest completion authority;
- Stop disappearing merely opens a settle window. If Stop returns, text/native activity changes,
  unanswered connector work remains, or the terminal message does not belong to this exact turn,
  completion is withdrawn;
- the degraded no-Fiber rule — visible prose after the settle window means `completed` — applies
  only to a generation this document has seen running (`unwitnessedGeneration`). A turn adopted
  from the app on reload has no document-side evidence until the Stop control has been seen for
  it; until then only the page model, an error, a user stop, a new send or the stall budget may
  close it. Live 2026-09-02: the committed interim prose of a running turn closed the adopted turn
  four seconds after the reload;
- a genuinely newer authored user message is a hard boundary for the previous turn, while page
  unload/`closeConversation` alone never invents its outcome.

The concrete page clocks matter because they define what the recovery layer is allowed to infer.
`TURN_SETTLE_MS = 4000`: Stop first disappearing starts that quiet window, Stop returning cancels
it with the same local generation intact, and `unknown` **never** becomes terminal merely because
four seconds elapsed. Manual Stop closes immediately. Independently, a Fiber descriptor whose exact
active turn exposes `endMessageId`/`end_turn:true` is stronger than a stale Stop control and may
close that exact local generation immediately; if the page outcome was otherwise still `unknown`,
that model-backed terminal proof supplies `completed`. The visible `data-interrupted` marker alone is
only an outcome candidate, not a terminal boundary, because ChatGPT transiently uses it between
tool/reasoning phases.

`STALL_MS = 10m` is likewise observation, not browser action. While ChatGPT still reports the turn
as generating, ten minutes without visible progress emits one app-visible `chat_error` and lets
`endOutcome()` classify a proven terminal boundary as `stalled`; that synthetic stall notice is not
marked recoverable and `content.js` does **not** reload the page. Reload/open authority stays in the
shared bridge→service-worker recovery machine. After any turn ends, `FIBER_SETTLE_MS = 90s` is only
a ceiling for late request-id/owner evidence: the content script keeps scanning the just-settled turn
while exact call ownership is incomplete and stops early as soon as the required Fiber evidence is
complete. It is not a 90-second delay before turn completion and not another recovery timer.

This is the conceptual reason **partial vs final** bugs are identity bugs. Commentary/progress,
native tool rails and final assistant answer are different semantic objects even when the DOM
renders them close together. Stable message/turn identity comes from ChatGPT's model/Fiber evidence
where available; DOM shape is presentation/action fallback, not permission to merge those roles.

**`fiber.js` is intentionally least trusted.** It emits a strict **allowlist** (not copied
props minus a denylist), never tool argument values, validates the exact CLF connector
names, and fails closed on unfamiliar React shapes. Its `postMessage` output is
page-controlled evidence useful for joining page to local truth — **never a credential**.
Its protocol version and the content-side expectations move together.

**Overwrite owns activity ordering, not the assistant answer.** `content.js::renderStreams()` no
longer rebuilds ChatGPT's answer subtree from captured HTML. ChatGPT remains the sole renderer for
assistant prose, code/document blocks and response actions; the companion mounts one sibling stream
containing only app-owned activity rows and hides only the native progress/tool rows that stream
proves it fully replaces. `websiteRenderForTurn()` joins a visible Fiber turn to durable activity by
exact ChatGPT message/thought/request identities — never by time, DOM position or a tail guess — and
`completeReplacementForTurn()` requires every page-authored object the Fiber descriptor names to be
represented before native activity is hidden. A connector call without request identity, a missing
assistant/thought row, contradictory explicit turn ownership, or no usable Fiber descriptor leaves
that turn native rather than showing a partial local reconstruction.

Presentation identity is deliberately stricter than a remembered DOM attribute. React may reuse an
assistant section for the next response, so `priorStreamRootCompatible()` keeps an old sibling root
only when current stable **message/activity** ids overlap the root's stored strong ids; request ids
are excluded because ChatGPT can reuse them across retries/turns. `hasUnrepresentedFiberCall()` also
breaks the short replacement grace immediately when Fiber already exposes a new call the app stream
cannot show. Otherwise a recently complete root may survive one brief feed/Fiber race to prevent
visible native↔synthetic flicker. During active user scrolling the repaint is frozen, and the next
pass restores a visible turn's viewport anchor after layout changes. These are presentation guards,
not alternate identity or recorder fallbacks; durable session data is never rewritten to make the
render fit.

The `/activity` reader is also a small liveness scheduler, not a fixed poll. `content.js::
activityPullDelay()` chooses 750 ms for visible generation/Goal drafting/final-presentation debt,
2 s for other active work (and hidden generation), 10 s for visible idle and 30 s for hidden idle.
`pendingPresentation` is one exact final assistant revision that already crossed the extension
journal but has not yet returned through the app-owned activity projection; setting it calls
`expediteActivityPull()`, and only the same final message id + exact text coming back clears it.
This is why a hidden/background tab cannot drop to the slow cadence while Goal is drafting or while
Overwrite still owes the user the final revision. Reuse `armNextActivityPull()` rather than adding
another hidden-tab timer/watch loop.

The service worker's document model is also **current implementation, not an aspirational one**.
Today `background.js` still carries separate `tabDocuments`, `tabEpochs`, bounded
`retiredDocuments` (last 8 per tab) and speculative `terminalDocuments`, all in `storage.session`.
Authority begins with Chrome's `MessageSender.documentId`, never a body field. A retired sender is
`stale_document`; the exact current document may advance `tabEpochs` but a lower epoch is
`stale_navigation`; `ownsDocument()` additionally refuses retired/terminal senders. A different
non-retired sender can be adopted by `authorizeDocument()` itself — `register_document` is **not**
the sole replacement path in today's code — while `registerDocument()` is the one bypass-authorized
bootstrap that can adopt fresh-reload provisional journal evidence before retiring the old current
document. `onUpdated(status='loading')` marks the current document terminal speculatively and keeps
the conversation binding only across a reload of the chat's **own** URL; a full load of any other
ChatGPT URL (the root, another chat, a project page), a leave to another site, or tab removal
releases the chat there and then (2026-09-03: typing chatgpt.com into a Prime's tab left it bound
until some later chat was given an id there, so the app never heard the page was gone). An SPA move
fires no `loading` status and stays the content script's to prove. A current terminal sender gets `tab_closed` unless `terminalPredictionWrong()` positively
re-reads the same Chrome tab as ChatGPT, no longer loading, with no `pendingUrl`, and the sender still
current; only then is the false terminal stamp cleared. Do not document or implement against a
hypothetical collapsed owner record until code/tests move together. Irreversible browser actions
always re-check this current document+epoch authority.

**Extension reload recovery is health-based, not install-event-based.** An unpacked extension reload
can leave the old isolated-world JavaScript globals alive while invalidating its `chrome.runtime`,
so a boolean “content script already ran” marker is not liveness. `content.js` publishes a versioned
`__CLF_CONTENT_RECORDER__` handle with `healthy()` + `stop()`: a healthy current-version incumbent
wins, while a dead/stale predecessor is stopped and replaced. `background.js::restoreChatgptTab()`
pings that handle; a healthy recorder still causes Fiber to be re-injected independently, while a
missing/stale recorder gets `chatgpt-dom.js` → MAIN-world `fiber.js` → `content.js` → CSS rebuilt in
that exact tab. `restoreOpenChatgptTabs()` runs both from install/update hooks **and unconditionally
when the service worker module starts**, because `chrome://extensions` Reload is not guaranteed to
deliver the install event. Service-worker wake alone therefore does one cheap health ping per open
ChatGPT tab and injects only when health/version proves repair is needed.

**Must hold.** ChatGPT is an SPA: every async result proves it still belongs to its
navigation epoch before mutating state. `pagehide` is **not** proof a conversation ended —
reload and bfcache fire it too; real closure is decided at the service-worker layer from tab
removal and navigation away. **Reload is not conversation close.** Content-script acceptance
means *handed to the journal*, not *stored by the app*, and the journal must never silently
lose something it already acknowledged as durable. Recovery must validate **every** context
whose health it needs — proving the isolated recorder is alive says nothing about a dead
MAIN-world Fiber helper. Recorder takeover is total ownership transfer: the predecessor must
disconnect MutationObservers and DOM/window handlers **and** unregister extension-level
`chrome.runtime.onMessage` / `chrome.storage.onChanged` listeners. An `alive=false` predecessor
must never answer a health check, compete for a worker-revival command, or repaint Overwrite
after the successor owns the document. **No wait in `content.js` may depend on the tab being in
front:** Chrome runs a hidden tab's chained timers once a minute after five minutes hidden, so every
periodic loop and every `sleep()` goes through `later()`, whose MessageChannel hop keeps the timer
chain at level one; a new `setTimeout`/`setInterval` loop in the recorder is a regression.

**Tests.** `content-script.test.ts`, `fiber.test.ts`, `extension.test.ts`.

## 14. The browser bridge — `bridge.ts`

Worker/resume markers have independent durable claims and receipts. A leased resume cannot
block an unrelated worker invitation. Only never-handed commands enter the opener; expiry never
turns a spent lease back into opening authority. Shared command-ledger snapshots commit serially,
including claim renewal and final receipts. A bound worker's leased transport remains until its
receipt or deadline settles it; sibling maintenance cannot retire it during ACK persistence.

A second loopback HTTP service on the first free port of **8765–8769**. The extension finds
it with `/hello`, silently provisions a bearer token with `/pair`, then uses authenticated
routes: `/status`, `/correlations`, `/events`, `/closed`, `/activity`, `/compact`,
`/goal/draft`, `/goal/ack`, `/goal/objective`, `/goal/open`, `/settings` (GET and POST),
`/commands/redeem`, `/commands/ack`. `/settings` is the one deliberately tiny config-write
surface available to the page: its POST accepts the flat boolean `autoCompact`, optionally one flat
`goal` **or** `loop` boolean (never both), plus optional `conversationId` for chat scoping.
`goal.ts::applyGoalSwitch()` is the pure pair reducer, not a
bridge-owned policy function. With a concrete `conversationId`, the bridge persists the result via
`goal.ts::setGoalSwitchNow()` into that chat's `goal-switches` row; only a New Chat with no concrete
id changes the app-wide `config.goal` default. Goal and Loop are therefore mutually exclusive by
construction, not two independent feature flags, and a page-local stop does not silently rewrite
every other chat. `/goal/objective` and `/goal/open` accept the same two words as an optional
`mode`, which is the *other* way that per-chat switch is written — see "A chat's own goal". None grants filesystem/process/Desktop reach. GET exists for the one composer
with no conversation to read `/activity` for: a New Chat.

**Must hold.** The token never enters the ChatGPT page — the service worker holds it in
extension-owned state and the app keeps its counterpart out of config and log surfaces. The
bridge exposes **no** filesystem, command, permission-widening or arbitrary-config route. Do not
turn `/settings` into a generic config escape hatch merely because two non-capability toggles are
already there. Protocol mismatch
against `BRIDGE_PROTOCOL` warns once rather than spamming. Concurrent startup must not race
on listener ownership.

Because this is where browser-observed lifecycle meets recorder, agents, continuation and
workspace state, a `bridge.ts` bug presents as a session, extension, or agent bug depending
on which end you inspect.

POST **`/events` is the cross-subsystem commit coordinator**, not merely “write these page rows”.
The extension journal treats HTTP 200 as permission to retire that batch, so every consequence that
would be unrecoverable after the row disappears must cross its own durable boundary first. Current
order is load-bearing:

```text
exact (agent, commandId) lost-worker-ACK recovery if present
 → exact page / turn_start liveness back into agents.ts
 → reconstruct worker origin from durable broker ownership when needed
 → recorder.ts::recordChatObservations()  (per-conversation serialized journal/message writes)
 → acceptGoalReplyNow() for every stable goalEligible final   ← durable before 200
 → noteRecoveryObservations() + activity/terminal deadlines
 → update worker context-token ceiling from the durable session
 → if a worker final is now proven across journal batches:
      stageWorkerConversationFinish()
      → persistCriticalSwarmNow()                              ← durable before 200
      → commit report / wake queued sleeper / release run
 → 200; only now may background.js drop the observation batch
```

A storage/broker failure at either Goal or worker-final barrier returns retryable 503, preserving
the browser-owned journal row for replay. This is why worker completion, Goal exactly-once and
broken-page recovery can all consume the same observation without inventing three independent
receipt systems.

Worker-final eligibility uses `chronology.ts::positionOf()` (canonical origin before revision seq)
and the final's own durable turn start when present. Any newer different turn start disqualifies
that old final. Refreshing an old final's HTML advances its storage cursor, never its authority to
put a revived worker to sleep.

Browser recovery now has **one per-conversation queue** in `bridge.ts::queueBrowserRecovery()`;
silence, recoverable assistant transport errors, missing mid-turn tabs and broken request-id joins
converge there instead of each owning a reload/open loop. The queued record is fenced by a stable
episode + receipt token and moves `queued -> handed -> done`; only a confirmed browser action is
"done", and meaningful new activity or turn completion retires only the repair kinds for which that
fact is actually authoritative.

**An adopted turn is bound only to a section below its question.** `seedResumeBaseline()` treats
the newest assistant section as the resumed turn's own only when it follows the newest user
message; a section above the question is a previous, finished answer, and binding the adopted
turn to it let that answer's end-turn bit close the live turn nine seconds after every reload of
the 2026-09-03 prime. With no section after the question the turn has no page evidence yet and
stays open. The `unwitnessedGeneration` flag likewise clears only when Stop is seen over a
section `generationTurn()` can bind, not on hydration's one-second Stop over an empty transcript.

**The page's word that a turn ended is not enough to write the next Goal message on.** A reloaded
page reads the transcript's last `end_turn` bit as a finished answer while the same request is
still calling tools, and a "Message delivery timed out" error closes the local turn the same way
(2026-09-03: the loop drafted twenty seconds after such an end and the chat ran two requests at
once). `/goal/draft` therefore files the obligation but refuses the draft with `chat_still_working`
while the recorder still has the chat's turn open (`chatIsWorking()` — a reopened turn stays open
until the page reports a real end, and the 2026-09-03 banner reported none), while
`runningToolCalls()` is non-zero, or while the chat's last attributed call is under `GOAL_QUIET_MS`
(one minute) old. The page keeps its claim and asks again every `GOAL_RETRY_MS` on the plain wait,
with no backoff, until the app says the chat has finished. Only the silence ticket (`g-silence-*`)
is drafted over an open turn: it is the app's own finding that the answer is over. A call that proves
the ended turn is still running (`recorder.ts::reopenFalselyEndedTurn`) withdraws the obligation
outright via `retireGoalDraftsFor()`. The silence path is the other half: a Goal/Loop chat gets its
silence reload, then `GOAL_SILENCE_LISTEN_MS` (one minute) of listening, and only a minute with no
tool call, no interim row, no message files the `g-silence-*` ticket; any of those re-arms the
two-minute clock so a chat that stops again later gets the same reload and minute again.

**A reload the page has not come back from is not answered with another.** A 300k-token chat
takes minutes to load — three, for the 2026-09-03 prime — and `inspectSilentChats()` used to
reload it again 23 seconds after an unattributed reload had, restarting the load. A chat in
`awaitingReturn` (set by `confirmRepair()`, cleared by the next `grantActivity()`) keeps its
silence deadline pushed to `lastBrowserRecoveryAt + BROWSER_RECOVERY_COOLDOWN_MS`; only a page
that never returns is reloaded when that runs out.

**The DOM layer reads each transcript section once.** `chatgpt-dom.js` keeps a per-section memo
(`sectionCache`: rows, markdown parts, tool blocks, progress boxes, `interrupted`) that its own
MutationObserver drops on any subtree, text or relevant attribute change, draining pending records
synchronously (`takeRecords()`) before every read. Before it, the one-second tick walked the whole
transcript six to eight times and took every message's text each time — most of a second of main
thread per second on a 300-turn chat, and the freeze behind the 2026-09-03 prime. Never read
message text or tool rows around the cache; add a field to the memo instead.

An ordinary open semantic turn grants its **conversation** a two-minute silence deadline in `activeUntil`.
Known Pro models instead use ten minutes from meaningful work/tool-start evidence. A late exact
picker or MCP identity promotes an unknown grant without resetting its evidence timestamp. A real
turn-end removes activity immediately; a genuinely newer exact MCP call can revive it. Pro never
receives an inactivity-generated Goal or automatic compaction. Picker presence alone is not work.
`grantActivity()` arms/pushes it from accepted current-turn evidence and attributed calls;
`endActivity()` removes it only on a real terminal. `armSilenceSweep()` owns one timer for the
earliest deadline across all chats, so a 30-second maintenance tick cannot silently add another
half-minute to the contract. Expiry queues one receipt-tracked browser recovery for an ordinary
chat, Prime or Worker alike; a confirmed one-shot repair is not repeated for the same episode.
**A resumed chat is armed at the commit** (`armResumedChat()`, called from both commit sites —
the `/compact` destination-marker route and the `/commands/ack` resume receipt): the moment S
names B, B gets the same grant an accepted turn would have earned. The 2026-09-02 automatic
handover showed why. B never reported its turn or bound its first request id, so its calls went
Unattributed and B, with no grant and no known turn, was not a repair candidate — the incident
had nothing to reload and B stayed stuck at its first tool call. With the grant, the silence and
unattributed sweeps cover B from the first second, exactly as they would a chat that had proved
itself.

Unattributed recovery is separate evidence feeding the same queue. One recorder verdict that a call
is **Unattributed** opens a 60-second
`unattributedIncident`; later attributed calls add their exact conversations to the incident's
`proven` set. At expiry, `repairUnattributedChat()` looks only at chats this app can still prove are
mid-turn (`repairCandidates()`), excludes those that proved their join, and queues one recovery for
each remaining broken chat. It does not choose "the one likely chat", and agent role is not an
eligibility gate. The incident carries the **request ids** of the unattributed calls that opened
and fed it; once it has reloaded anybody those ids go into `unattributedReloadedRequests`, and a
later unattributed call under one of them opens nothing — the reload is tried once per server turn,
however the reloaded page re-labels its local turn, and a *different* request id (the user's next
message from the phone, say) is a different turn with its own reload. Any `chat_error` the page
shows queues an `assistant-error` repair — whatever the DOM classifier said about it and whether or
not the page could name its turn — even while attributed MCP calls continue server-side. A final-tab close
may queue `no-tab` when `tabRecoveryWanted()` holds (Goal/Loop chat, or `recoverAgentTabs` on) and
this app is owed a running turn in that chat. "Owed" is the app's own fact, read in `/closed`
before the close forgets it: the page's open turn **or** a live `activeUntil` grant (an attributed
call or current-turn observation inside the silence window), or a Worker slot the close itself
detached — a document being torn down has no Stop control and reports "completed" whatever the
server is doing (2026-09-03: worker-1 said so one second before its `/closed` while its request id
went on calling tools). A Prime or plain chat needs the working fact; a plain chat also needs durable
`toolCalls>0`; a sleeping worker's tab closing is not an event. `queueMissingTab()` logs every
verdict, reopen or not, with its reason. Silence reads the same `tabRecoveryWanted()` predicate; a
silent chat it refuses is spent, not reloaded. The extension owns the final **reload
existing exact tab vs open exact conversation** choice at action time, so stale app-side tab guesses
cannot create a duplicate.

`assistant-error` starts even earlier at the selector boundary: `chatgpt-dom.js::errors()` records
visible ChatGPT errors, but only a **whole normalized notice** matching `transportFailure()` receives
`recoverable:true`; ordinary assistant prose that merely quotes those words is not an error. Hidden
live-region noise and CLF-owned surfaces are ignored, while a generic visible alert may still enter
the transcript as evidence without granting browser-repair authority. A visible failure card may
carry no alert role or assistant markdown; the exact Retry button is then the semantic anchor, and
the DOM reader climbs only to the nearest ancestor whose **whole** normalized text matches that same
transport-failure vocabulary. It never searches arbitrary page prose for those words. When a
transport notice lives inside an assistant turn, `content.js` may put it in recorder chronology only after exact section-node
ownership proves which **local generation id** owns it; a reused ChatGPT page turn id is never enough.
A top-level banner,
which has no page-turn identity of its own, uses the local generation in which its node first appeared.
If an in-turn occurrence cannot prove that mapping, it is recorded **unscoped**: ChatGPT's raw page
turn id never enters `SessionEvent.turnId`. Neither `recoverable` nor the turn id gates the reload
any more: `bridge.ts::noteRecoveryObservations()` queues `assistant-error` for every `chat_error`
observation (the page's own de-duplication in `unreportedError()` is what keeps a banner still on
screen from re-queueing), and what rations it is the **once-per-user-turn budget** below.

The five recovery reasons are intentionally different **evidence**, but not different action
machines:

| Reason | Who is allowed to create it | What proves the episode over |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `silence` | `inspectSilentChats()` after the semantic-turn `activeUntil` deadline expires — the only qualification is two minutes with no tool call and no page change on a chat that had activity | meaningful new current-turn activity before handoff cancels it; a confirmed reload re-grants the chat `CHAT_SILENCE_MS` (the reload is its chance; a model writing a long answer makes no durable progress until it lands) or, for a Goal/Loop chat, `GOAL_SILENCE_LISTEN_MS` (one minute), and only a second silent window after that spends the one-shot: the stale sweep sleeps a worker, and `fileSilenceGoalTickets()` files a **Goal ticket** for a Goal/Loop chat — the same durable `goal-replies` obligation a finished answer files, under a `g-silence-<time>` turn, which the page collects on its next pull like any restored pending reply, drafts and sends. A turn that ends **failed** re-grants the watch instead of ending it: the page gave up, the model usually did not. A user Stop ends activity and never reaches any of this |
| `unattributed` | `repairUnattributedChat()` after the recorder opened one 60s post-grace incident and this exact mid-turn chat never joined the incident's `proven` set; refused when the call's request id is already in `unattributedReloadedRequests` | an attributed call proves the request-id join works, or a **later turn ends** and advances outcome-agnostic `endedTurns`; the rationing is per **request id**, not per turn |
| `assistant-error` | `noteRecoveryObservations()` from any `chat_error`, turn id or not, recoverable or not | the browser carries the repair out, or a **later turn ends** and advances outcome-agnostic `endedTurns`; the broken turn's own end is deliberately pre-counted and does not cancel the repair. The once-per-user-turn budget (`turnRepairSpent`) is charged at **confirm** to the turn the chat is on then — `turnKeyFor()`: the running generation, or `ended:<count>` when none is running — and released the moment the chat is on a different one (read lazily in `queueBrowserRecovery()` as well as on the browser's pass), so a failed turn whose end preceded the reload cannot leave its charge on the turn that starts later. Ordinary server-side attributed calls do not cancel it because they prove attribution, not page-stream health |
| `no-tab` | `queueMissingTab()` for a final tab that closed on a chat this app is owed a turn in: a Worker the close detached, or a Prime/plain chat with the page's open turn or a live activity grant (a plain chat also needs a recorded tool call) — under `recoverAgentTabs`, or always for a Goal/Loop chat | page/turn activity after reopening, or the normal agent lifecycle decision |
| `goal` | `inspectOwedGoals()` when a `goal-replies` obligation this run accepted is still `pending` and its chat has been quiet for the current backoff step | the obligation is discharged, expired or superseded by a newer reply — or the five-step schedule runs out |

`silence` and `goal` are **chat**-scoped; `unattributed` and `assistant-error` are **turn**-scoped
(`bridge.ts::TURN_SCOPED_REPAIRS`), and that distinction is load-bearing. The three paths are
otherwise **independent of one another**: none waits on, or is refused because, another one has
or has not fired. Silence has no budget beyond its own two minutes; the error reload is rationed per
user turn; the unattributed reload per request id. A turn-scoped repair is
retired only by a *later* turn ending, so a page that dies on the broken turn keeps one forever —
and `inspectSilentChats()` used to read any held repair as "a recovery is already running", which is
how a chat that had been dead for eighteen minutes was never reloaded. `silence` therefore both
ignores a held turn-scoped repair and **supersedes** it in `queueBrowserRecovery()`: its reload does
everything the stuck one would have done. `no-tab` supersedes a held turn-scoped repair for the same
reason — the tab that repair would reload is gone, and the reopen is everything it would have done.
Nothing supersedes `no-tab` itself: it is chat-scoped, ordinary activity clears it, so it cannot be
the stuck kind.

There is one **current manual-Stop hole** in that turn-scoped rule. An `assistant-error` queued while
the broken turn is still open snapshots `endedTurns + 1`, `noteRecoveryActivity()` refuses to clear
assistant-error, and `retireSpentRepairs()` knows only whether the counter later became `>` that
snapshot. If the user explicitly Stops that same broken turn before Chrome acts, its own end merely
reaches equality, so the already-queued repair can still reload afterward. There is no terminal
outcome in the repair-retirement decision today. The same hole exists **inside one accepted batch**:
recorder state applies the matching `turn_end(stopped)` first, then `noteRecoveryObservations()` scans
that batch's recoverable `chat_error` and can queue a brand-new repair after terminal cleanup already
ran. The repair must retain the assistant-error's exact **source turn id** as cancellation evidence
(while keeping `endedTurns` as the post-reload spending mechanism), and a matching
`turn_end(stopped)` must veto it whether it arrived before or in the same batch as the error.
Failed/interrupted completion remains repairable. That veto remains meaningful until the browser
crosses the pre-action claim described below; after an action is atomically claimed, Stop cannot
retroactively un-send a reload already authorized. Do not add a content-side anti-reload flag.

The shared `lastBrowserRecoveryAt` floor is three minutes for error/unattributed actions,
but **`silence`, `goal`, `compaction` and `no-tab` bypass it**: the first three already paid their own
complete inactivity contract, so `queueBrowserRecovery()` sets `notBefore = now` instead of stacking
another unrelated wait on top, and `no-tab` has nothing the floor could protect — the floor keeps a
second reload off a page that is still loading, and a closed tab has no page (2026-09-03: a worker
the user closed waited two and a half minutes under the floor because a silence reopen had landed
moments earlier). This distinction is part of the timing contract, not an optimization.

`no-tab` therefore queues **immediately from the close**: no two-minute silence threshold, no
three-minute floor. One close is one reopen. A closed tab is first-hand proof the page is gone *now*. An ordinary chat
qualifies on the one fact that makes it this app's business — its session has recorded a tool call,
so the turn still running server-side is running against this connector. A chat that has never called
a tool is the user's own browsing and stays closed. The episode is stamped with
the moment the page went (`detachedAt`, else the session's `endedAt`), never with the moving
`activeUntil` deadline: a detached chat goes on calling tools, and an activity-tracking stamp would
mint a fresh episode — and a second tab — out of the very work the repair exists to keep alive.

`multiAgent.recoverAgentTabs` is **not** a master “broken-site recovery” switch. Turning it off
blocks the agent-specific `no-tab` path for a conversation that is **still owned** as a detached
Prime/Worker when `queueMissingTab()` runs. `/closed` first lets `primeConversationGone()` /
`workerConversationGone()` update broker ownership and only then classifies no-tab recovery; if a
Prime with no reusable workers/reports is removed from the run at that point, the same conversation
falls through the ordinary-chat branch and may qualify from durable `toolCalls>0` even with
`recoverAgentTabs=false`. It does **not** suppress
`silence`, `unattributed`, or `assistant-error` for any chat, and it does not suppress `no-tab` for a
non-agent chat whose durable session already proves this connector participated via at least one
tool call. Pending repairs and `activeUntil` keep `recoveryMonitoring` alive independently of that
preference; the setting controls agent-tab resurrection, not the shared broken-page engine.

There is also a **current premature-custody bug** in repair cancellation. `/status` changes one repair
to `handed` **before** the service worker has even scanned current tabs, but
`noteRecoveryActivity()` can then delete handed `silence` / `no-tab` / `goal` repairs and the
attributed-call path can delete a handed `unattributed` repair. Nothing tells the browser that its
already-issued token disappeared, so it may still reload/open and return a receipt the app now treats
as stale. Manual Stop has the same physical race. The root is that discovery and action custody are
currently the same read.

`takePendingRepair()` is the current handoff protocol. A `handed` repair with no matching confirmation is
put back at the **end** of the queue on the next maintenance pass so one impossible action cannot
starve other broken chats. Each handout mints a fresh token; `/status?repaired=<token>` is the only
fact that moves that exact handout to `done`. Conversation id alone is not a receipt because a late
receipt from an older broken turn must not close a newer repair for the same chat.

The recovery text visible in the local timeline is **projection of that same repair**, not another
watcher. Each queued episode owns one stable `progressId`; `updateRepairProgress()` first records
"Trying to reload…" through `recorder.ts::recordProgress()` and then replaces that same logical
progress row, preserving its original
position, with either the confirmed Reload/Reopen result or the retryable action failure. The repair
token still owns correctness. A progress row is observability only and can be absent when no unique
session can be proven; it never authorizes, confirms or suppresses a browser action.

The same row is painted into the ChatGPT page by `content.js::renderRepairNotices()`. It arrives on
`/activity` like every other row (`progressId` `browser-repair:*`, no `turnId`), is deliberately
never folded into a turn group, and is placed between turns by the app's durable user anchors: before
the first user message recorded after it, or after the last turn. It shows whenever the page is
paired, independent of Overwrite, and follows the app's in-place rewrite because `progress` is an
upsert kind on the page's stream store.

The browser half is `background.js::maintain()`. It runs on every 30-second alarm and on browser
startup **whenever the worker is paired**, tabs or no tabs — a worker holding nothing after a browser
restart is exactly the one that has to open the chat the app is owed. It calls `/status`, scans **actual current ChatGPT
tabs immediately before acting**, and `conversationForTab()` resolves identity in one strict order:
concrete current `/c/<id>` or Project `/g/<project>/c/<id>` wins, then a concrete `pendingUrl`; only
while all exposed URLs are still ChatGPT-origin but temporarily root/id-less may the durable
`tabConversations[tabId]` binding stand in. A concrete non-ChatGPT URL returns null and a concrete
different chat always beats stale registry state. If at least one exact tab exists it reloads one deterministically,
preferring the tab already bound in `tabConversations` and otherwise the lowest tab id; if none
exists it opens exactly `https://chatgpt.com/c/<id>`. A **tab-query** failure produces no receipt,
leaving the handed token unconfirmed so the next maintenance pass requeues it; a
`chrome.tabs.reload()` / `chrome.tabs.create()` exception sends the explicit negative receipt
`repairFailed=<token>&repairAction=reloaded|reopened`, which `failRepairAttempt()` records and
requeues immediately. Only a completed browser action sends `repaired=<token>`. The MV3 worker's
single 30-second alarm is broader than recovery state: `retryWanted()` keeps it armed for journal,
close-outbox, command-ACK, deferred-revival, **any registered ChatGPT tab**, extension-owned discard
protection, or `recoveryMonitoring`. Open tabs matter because this alarm is the only periodic wake
that can ask the app whether a new silence/assistant-error repair appeared while the worker slept;
the alarm is a browser-wakeup floor, **not a second repair policy**. Final-tab close is faster:
`releaseTab()` drains `/closed` custody and, when that delivery succeeds, calls `maintain()`
immediately so a newly queued `no-tab` repair can be collected in the same lifecycle path rather
than waiting for the alarm. Never move tab election into `bridge.ts` or add a parallel reload timer
in the page — the service worker is the only place with action-time tab truth.

That action path also has a **current double-handout race**. `maintain()` has no in-flight lock, both
the periodic alarm and `releaseTab()` can enter it, and each `/status` call requeues any prior
`handed` repair before minting a fresh token. Two overlapping passes can therefore receive the same
episode under T1/T2 and both act. Do not fix these three races independently. Replace the premature
take-on-`/status` boundary with one **peek → atomic pre-action claim** inside the existing repair state
machine: status may expose the queued candidate so the service worker can inspect real tabs, but
`queued → handed` and the action token are granted only by a compare-and-set claim of the **exact
peeked `(conversationId, episode)`** immediately before `chrome.tabs.reload/create`, and only if that
same episode is still queued/live. The token is minted by the successful claim, not by the peek.
Stop/activity/attribution may
cancel while queued; only one concurrent maintainer can win the claim. **The whole `maintain()` owner
must also be single-flight/coalesced.** A success or explicit negative receipt resolves the claimed
attempt immediately; if the service-worker lifetime dies and no receipt arrives, only the *next
serialized maintenance pass* may put that still-unconfirmed claim back in the queue. Serializing the
owner is what prevents that lost-receipt recovery from requeueing another pass while the first is
still between claim and browser action. This removes the need for a parallel cancellation channel,
browser-side action dedupe or a second recovery owner. Regress same-batch Stop+error,
Stop/activity between peek and claim, concurrent alarm+close entry, and a claimed action whose receipt
is lost across the MV3 lifetime.

One current bridge regression encodes the pre-fix assumption and must move with this invariant:
`bridge.test.ts` **“does not let a receipt from a spent repair close the repair of a later broken
turn”** retires a token already handed by `/status` before its receipt arrives. Keep the valuable
late-receipt fence, but split two facts the current test conflates: page/turn activity may not replace
a **claimed** episode with a different episode, while a later serialized maintenance pass may
explicitly requeue that **same still-unconfirmed episode** to recover a lost receipt. Only that retry
transition may stale the old token before a receipt; a different broken turn does not get to do so.
Nearby turn-repair tests happen to illustrate retirement with a later **completed** turn; their prose
is not the contract. Production `endedTurns` counts every accepted named `turn_end` regardless of
`completed|stopped|failed|interrupted|stalled`, as the table above states.

**Tests.** `bridge.test.ts`, `extension.test.ts`.

### Browser commands: intent → durable lease → page → durable receipt

Do not describe worker/resume delivery as "open a URL and type"; the URL is only how a page gets
near the command. The authority path is:

```text
broker / continuation accepts semantic intent
  → bridge.ts persists CommandSpec in bridge-commands
  → fresh worker/resume: app opens preferred Chrome/Chromium (browser.ts), URL carries only marker
    exact-chat revive: extension service worker elects/reuses/opens the bound worker chat instead
  → eligible/current content document asks service worker to redeem marker
  → POST /commands/redeem atomically establishes queued→leased owner
  → bridge returns exact text + target fence for that still-live command
  → content verifies fresh-vs-exact-chat precondition, types and waits for ChatGPT acceptance
  → page ACK is first accepted into background.js commandAckOutbox
  → service worker retries POST /commands/ack until app accepts it
  → worker/resume terminal ACK: bridge records receipt + retires command
    revive `sent`: command stays leased until exact worker liveness or revival deadline settles it
```

A resume is committed twice over, and whichever arrives first wins: from the `[[CLF-RESUME:…]]`
marker the destination page finds in Fiber (`reconcileContinuationMarker()` → `/compact` with
`destinationMessageId`), and from the page's `sent` ACK carrying the conversation id ChatGPT gave
the fresh chat (`/commands/ack` → `commitContinuationResult()`). The second exists because on
2026-09-02 a 34k-character brief was sent, the prime in chat B read its predecessor session and went
to work, and the marker was never redeemed: the session stayed on chat A, chat B was refused
`AGENTS_BUSY` as a stranger, and the loop was dead until the user noticed. The page's journal gate
(`continuationJournalPending`) is released when `/activity` reports the chat as a `resume`
destination with a session, not from the ACK's reply, which is the outbox's and not the app's.

There are exactly three semantic `CommandSpec` variants: `worker` (fresh chat), `resume` (fresh
chat tied to one continuation token/session), and `revive` (the already-bound exact worker
conversation + run incarnation + unique wake identity). The deadlines differ because the semantic
risks differ:

- **Fresh worker before any page owns it:** the chat this app opened has **`WORKER_REDEEM_MS`
  (20s)** to redeem its marker (plus the browser launch window when the app had to start the
  browser). A page silent past that is dead, not slow: the same single-owner command is opened
  **once more**, and a second silence fails the slot at once so the workers queued behind it open
  (2026-09-02, worker-4 held its siblings for ninety seconds). A command still in line has no
  clock of its own; the worker invitation has an absolute **120s bootstrap lifetime from
  creation**, so a late handout cannot keep a slot forever.
- **Fresh worker after redeem:** the page-owned attempt is one-shot. Its lease is bounded by the
  smaller of **90s from claim** and the remaining absolute worker-bootstrap lifetime. A page-reported
  bootstrap failure is terminal rather than a prompt to open another worker chat.
- **Resume:** the same claimant may redeem idempotently, and another document may take over only
  while the durable destination send checkpoint still proves **pre-dispatch**. Once dispatch is
  ambiguous/possible, no second click is authorized. Its outer authority is the continuation's
  existing **10-minute TTL**, not an invitation clock.
- **Revive:** browser send/ACK is one wake attempt. The broker's `waking` reservation is capped at
  **`REVIVAL_DEADLINE_MS` (90s) from the wake** until the browser proves delivery, and at
  **`REVIVAL_ACTIVITY_MS` (90s + `DETACHED_SILENCE_MS`)** once it has — the same silence budget a
  working worker gets before it is judged asleep. A `sent` ACK moves the deadline exactly once;
  exact worker liveness must still arrive. The old flat 30 s ran out while woken workers were still
  reading, reported them unwakeable to the prime, and parked runs whose workers were working.
- **Restored stale transport rows:** the broad command TTL bounds forgotten control records, but it
  never extends a semantic worker/continuation/revival lifetime.

`/commands/redeem` is the arbitration cut. The page owner/lease means duplicate tab, reload or
reopen cannot make a second document type the same payload, except for the explicitly replay-safe
resume takeover while the continuation still proves no dispatch. After an irreversible browser result,
the service-worker ACK outbox is custody: the page may disappear and the app still eventually
learns the outcome. App receipts make a repeated ACK idempotent across app restart.

Fresh worker/resume delivery and exact-chat revival deliberately have different **draft ownership**.
A fresh command first proves the app-marked page is still a New Chat, then
`chatgpt-dom.js::insertPrompt(text, true)` may replace ChatGPT-restored/autosaved stale New-Chat draft
state; after insertion content re-reads the entire whitespace-normalized composer and aborts if the
user changed it before Send. Revival never gets that overwrite privilege: before redeem,
`revivalSubmitReady()` requires the exact worker conversation plus `composerSubmitReady()`, whose
native-page half includes an **empty** connected/editable composer and no Stop/generation control.
Thus “replace stale draft” is fresh-chat bootstrap ownership, not a generic convenience for commands
to overwrite whatever is in an existing chat.

Revive redeem has one deliberate **ordered cross-file** exception to the generic “lease is atomic”
shorthand above: broker wake custody is persisted first (`claimWorkerRevival` + critical swarm
snapshot), then the exact bridge command page-owner lease is persisted, and only after **both**
succeed may the text escape. A crash between those writes therefore leaves a durable `waking`
broker claim but no delivered payload; the same page can retry the lease safely. Never reverse that
order — a page-owned text lease with no durable worker-slot/wake claim would make browser side
effects outrun broker authority.

Bridge startup has an equally important **restore-before-publication** boundary. `startBridgeOnce()`
may have a loopback socket bound while `restoreCommands()` is still reconciling disk with the
broker/continuation authorities; during that window every request gets retryable
`503 bridge_recovering`. `restoredCommandSpec()` accepts worker/bootstrap rows only for the exact
current run and broker state, revive rows only for the exact current run + waking/active worker,
and resume rows only while the matching continuation WAL still authorizes them. An expired 30s
revival moves the exact broker worker back to sleeping **and fsyncs that swarm state before** the old
command may be pruned. `planCommandRestore()` builds only local arrays; the reconciled command set,
receipts, continuation tokens and deadline timers become live together at the single publication
cut near the end of `restoreCommands()`. If that recovery barrier fails, bridge startup closes the
socket and retries from durable authority later rather than exposing half-restored command state.

`browser.ts` prefers installed Chrome channels/Chromium because orchestration markers are useful
only in a browser that can host the extension. It tries the next compatible executable if launch
of an earlier candidate fails; `index.ts` uses the system default only as a last-resort warning
path, not as proof the command can be redeemed.

That default-browser fallback is **orchestration-only**. `bridge.ts::setBrowserOpener()` is the
injection point; `index.ts` wires it to preferred Chromium first and Electron `shell.openExternal()`
as the warning fallback for worker/resume URLs so the user at least sees the generated ChatGPT
target when no compatible Chromium can be launched, with an explicit warning that command
redemption requires the extension. Chats **Open Chat** does not use that fallback: IPC calls
`openInPreferredBrowser()` directly and returns “Chrome or Chromium was not found” rather than
opening an arbitrary default browser that cannot host the companion extension. Do not merge these
policies merely because both currently call the same preferred-browser helper first.

## 15. Compact & Resume — `session/continuation.ts`

**The local session id is the durable identity.** ChatGPT conversations A and B are
frontends attached to that one session in sequence.

```text
chat A owns session S
  → open continuation token for S
  → claim source prompt (nothing typed) → arm the click → A sends [[CLF-HANDOFF:token]]
  → bind ChatGPT's stable user id → exact terminal assistant id supplies the brief
  → store brief verbatim; open one marked fresh chat
  → claim bootstrap (nothing typed) → arm the click → B sends [[CLF-RESUME:token]]
  → bind B + ChatGPT's stable user id before ordinary page journaling
  → preflight   freeze prime/swarm transfers that must move atomically
  → DURABLE OWNERSHIP COMMIT   rebind S from A to B on disk   ← semantic point of no return
  → publish/complete     recorder mapping, workspace/Goal/swarm projections + WAL completion
  → B continues session S
```

**The continuation is the only clock over the swarm handover.** `openContinuationNow` begins the
prime transfer, and only the continuation's commit or abort ends it; `agents.ts` keeps no deadline
of its own for it. The independent ten-minute `TRANSFER_TTL_MS` that used to run beside the
transaction expired under a live automatic continuation whose handoff turn took eleven minutes
(2026-09-01), the commit was refused, and the session was stranded between A and B. Do not
reintroduce a second clock; if a handover must end, end the continuation.

**Chat A gets no tool while its handoff is being asked for.** From the moment the marked source
prompt is submitted (`sourceSend` dispatched or sent) until the commit makes A `superseded`,
`kernel.ts::dispatchTracked` refuses every call from A with `COMPACTION_IN_PROGRESS_REFUSAL`
(`continuation.ts::compactingConversation()`), which tells the model to write the brief now. The
page's stop-and-settle barrier is not a guarantee: ChatGPT's Stop control can vanish while the
server-side turn goes on calling tools under the same request id, and a zero in-flight count read
between two calls is not an ended turn. The refusal is what makes a lingering turn harmless and
what gets the brief written in seconds instead of after the turn's remaining task.

**An asked-for automatic handover has a deadline; an intended one has none.** An automatic ticket
waits on the WAL without a clock while the chat is working, because the chat may be mid-turn for
hours before it is safe to ask. From the moment the brief request is on its way (`askedAt`, stamped
at the first `sourceSend` dispatch or state change past `awaiting-summary`), chat A is refused every
tool, so a handover the model never finishes would fence A for good; `AUTOMATIC_HANDOVER_TTL_MS`
(six hours from `askedAt`) aborts it instead and the chat's next working turn opens a fresh
ticket. A record from before the field existed starts that clock at the restart that loads it.
Manual continuations keep their ten-minute clock from opening. A `committed` record whose session
has since moved on again (a later handover out of B) stays committed on restore: the first move
was real, and aborting it would un-supersede A.

**Must hold.** If preflight or the durable session rebind fails, **A keeps the session**. Once
session metadata durably says B owns S, the semantic move has happened even if the process crashes
before projection publication or the final continuation-WAL completion write. Recovery then repairs
the recorder/workspace/Goal/swarm projections and marks the transaction committed; it does **not**
roll session ownership back to A or reinterpret post-rebind cleanup failure as a failed move. Never implement
compaction by creating a second session or copying history — the whole feature is continuity
of one durable id. Automatic compaction is a live level plus liveness decision **made by the
app**: `bridge.ts::considerAutomaticCompaction()` files the ticket from `grantActivity()` — an
attributed call or current-turn observation — when the session is over the line and
`chatIsWorking()`, so a page that has frozen mid-turn (2026-09-03) is still compacted. An idle
old chat never fires merely because it sits above the threshold; the page's only part is to
resume the ticket it reads back as `job` (raising its tab first for an automatic one), a
transient pre-send barrier failure is retried by the app's pickups, and the continuation
transaction is the sole durable authority once either prompt crosses its semantic send
boundary. Pickups are phased on the ticket's durable position (`inspectOwedCompactions()`):
while the prompt is unsent, a raised reload every two minutes, five times, then the ticket is
abandoned (`handoff_never_sent`) and the next working turn opens a fresh one; while the brief
is being written, every five minutes, three times; once it has landed, the resume every
quarter-hour, three times. Browser documents, `sessionStorage`, local generation ids and
command leases are never semantic ownership.

The rebind also retires A's **execution** authority. Exact request-id proof from A remains useful
for forensics, but it cannot run a new local tool after S names B: `kernel.ts` refuses it before the
handler, and `recorder.ts` files the refused row under Unattributed activity with terminal
`superseded` attribution so deterministic repair can never place it back in B. Such a refusal is
historical evidence, not liveness: it may not revive a worker, acknowledge its inbox or refresh B's
activity clock. A's **late page observations** are filed the same way (`recorder.ts::supersededLineage`):
prose from a superseded conversation with no live mapping and no current session is stored into the
lineage session S without any activity, turn or Goal effect, and `initializeSessionForConversation`
refuses to mint a session for it. Before this, A's re-render of the brief seconds after the commit
minted a shadow session holding nothing but the brief's HTML (2026-09-02). B's programmatic Resume send mints the same exact composer receipt as a manual send,
so its zero-anchor user row opens the local turn before the first connector request races in.
ChatGPT currently represents that marked prompt and its assistant reply as adjacent Fiber turns;
`answerTurnFor()` is the one relationship used both for handoff capture and for binding B's
partials/calls/final to the opened local turn. Session `contextTokens` reset at the durable rebind and
drive UI pressure; lifetime `estimatedTokens` remains a separate historical total.

One projection seam is still duplicated in current source. Normal commit funnels through
`publishCommittedProjection()`, but `restoreContinuations()`'s “session already durably belongs to B”
branch manually repeats recorder/workspace/Goal/swarm projection instead of calling that routine.
Quality-first repair is to make **one committed-projection owner** serve normal commit and durable-B
restore for facts that genuinely are continuation projections. Exec ownership is **not** one of
those: proven processes are already keyed to the durable local session principal, remain stable
across A→B, and have no move helper. Do not patch `write_stdin` to adopt B after denial or add a
resume-only exec recovery path.

Before that transaction is even opened, `content.js::startCompact()` re-fetches `/activity` and
requires the app to positively confirm this exact chat is not a worker. That check happens **before
the destructive Stop-button barrier** because a reloaded worker document can temporarily lack its
local role projection. If the app cannot answer, nothing is interrupted. `stopAndSettle()` then
waits up to 15s for ChatGPT generation to stop and up to 30s for app-reported running local tools to
reach zero; three consecutive unknown tool-count polls fail closed as “could not verify zero”.
Manual and automatic compaction use this same barrier. Do not add a cheaper auto-only path: the
machine-state handoff is trustworthy only if both ChatGPT and the local tools are standing still.

The continuation itself has a six-state durable state machine:

| State | Durable meaning | Safe next decisions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `awaiting-summary` | source chat owns S; handoff turn is in progress / its exact terminal answer has not yet become a stored brief | source send may still be claimed according to its send checkpoint; no destination may commit |
| `awaiting-chat` | brief file + continuation state say this exact handoff is published/claimable; S still belongs to A | open/claim one replacement chat; source remains authoritative |
| `claimed` | one replacement claimant durably owns the brief/opening attempt | same claimant may retry idempotently; a second claimant is refused |
| `committing` | preflight succeeded and durable session rebind may be in flight | **do not sweep/abort on a timer**; reconcile from session metadata because either side of the write may have landed |
| `committed` | session metadata says B owns S and projections have been/will be repaired | idempotent recovery/publication only |
| `aborted` | transaction will not move S | A keeps ownership; no browser/document state may resurrect it |

`transitionNow()` embodies the WAL rule: the proposed semantic state is written immediately
**before** it becomes the live published state. If that write fails, continuation code queues the
old authoritative snapshot again so `durable.ts` cannot later retry the rejected generation and
make an operation the caller saw fail reappear after restart.

Each prompt has **two** durable writes around its click, because a document can die on either
side of it and the two sides have opposite answers. `attempted-unresolved` is written before the
composer is submitted at all, so it *proves* nothing reached ChatGPT: a reload, tab close,
browser restart or app restart replays it, and it is equally the state a second live document
may claim. `dispatched-unresolved` is written immediately before the click, so it proves
nothing — `CLF_DOM.send()` clicks first and watches for acceptance seconds later, and neither
the page nor the app can tell a click that never happened from one whose request outlived its
document. That state is never replayed by anything: it ends at ChatGPT's own marked message, or
at an explicit cancel, or at the transaction's TTL. A surfaced ambiguity is the correct outcome
there; a second Send is not. Exactly one caller can move `attempted-unresolved ->
dispatched-unresolved`, which is what makes the click at-most-once without any clock, tab
identity or claim token. Manual and automatic compaction call this exact same path.

Handoff capture has another publication boundary. `handoff.ts::prepareHandoff()` writes the brief
file first; that file alone is **not** a published continuation. The continuation WAL transition is
the semantic acceptance, and only after it lands is the session `handoff` event published. If the
process dies in the tiny opposite window, restart repairs the presentation event. This avoids
`lastHandoffId` advertising a brief belonging to a rejected transaction.

The safety floor is deliberately much lower than the prompt's quality target: any brief under 200
characters is refused, and a session of at least 20k estimated tokens requires at least 1,000
characters. Those are "cannot possibly be a usable whole handoff" guards; the 10k–30k-token prompt
target is guidance to ChatGPT, not a validator. `resumeBootstrapMatches()` canonicalizes only the
known NBSP/mojibake + line-ending presentation artifacts before provenance comparison — arbitrary
Unicode/whitespace normalization would turn provenance into fuzzy matching.

**Restore decides from durable ownership, never from the remembered phase.** For a restored
`committing` continuation, if session metadata already points to B, the durable move landed and
recovery repairs provenance/recorder/workspace/Goal/swarm projection. If it still points to A,
startup does **not** perform `rebindSession(A→B)` itself: if the original ten-minute lifetime has
expired it aborts, otherwise it thaws/re-arms Prime transfer, rolls the continuation back to
`claimed` (when a claimant still exists) or `awaiting-chat`, clears `to`, and lets the later
claim/command retry cross `commitContinuationResult()` and the durable rebind barrier again. If a
third conversation owns the session, recovery aborts rather than stealing it. Open/claimed
continuations retain their original ten-minute lifetime across restart; restart does not grant a
fresh TTL.

`resume-gate.ts` is deliberately tiny and temporary. It is armed **before** opening B and again
when a claimed continuation is restored, for at most 60 seconds, so recorder events already sitting
in the extension journal cannot win the race by inventing a brand-new local session for B. The
gate is suppression of a known race, never ownership: the continuation/session metadata remain the
authority, and expiry favors visible recoverable shadow state over blocking unrelated recording
forever.

One **legacy compatibility repair is still live and must not be mistaken for the normal design**:
`continuation.ts::repairPrimeFromResumeShadow()`. There are currently two compatibility callers:
bridge `/activity` invokes it for a non-worker chat that lacks a Goal objective, and
`tools-core.ts::callerNow()` invokes it after exact `agents` caller identity is proved but before
broker membership is evaluated. Older installed builds could create replacement B as a small
`origin.kind='resume'` recorder session *before* the real continuation transferred A's
workspace/Goal/prime projections, so either reopening B or making an exact agents call from B can
heal that historical split. The repair is positive-proof-only: B must durably name source session
S, S must still own A, the target may not be worker-owned, and B's authored history must contain the
exact resume bootstrap derived from S's matching collision WAL or newest still-uncommitted handoff.
It re-reads broker ownership after all filesystem awaits, then moves only the missing
workspace/Goal/broker projections. **It does not rebind or delete B's shadow recorder session.**
These hot-path calls are legacy damage repair, not the current continuation design; new Compact &
Resume logic must use the continuation transaction + resume gate instead of adding callers or
broadening this compatibility path.

There is a separate **current** bridge from Resume into Goal that solves a page-observation race
without becoming durable chat authority. After this document genuinely sends a `resume` bootstrap
and the app ACKs the continuation into concrete B, `content.js::rememberResumeGoalPending()` stores
`{conversationId, commandId, optional turnId}` in tab `sessionStorage` under
`clf-resume-goal-v1`; `bindResumeGoalTurn()` attaches the real local generation when one was
observed. This covers hidden/throttled B completing its entire first answer before the isolated
world ever saw a live generation, and the smaller race where the generation ended before B's moved
Goal config arrived. `maybeRecoverResumeGoalTurn()` waits for **post-commit `/activity` policy**,
requires exactly the single resume user turn, refuses busy/unusable/nonterminal state, and accepts
only a genuinely completed answer (ordinary terminal outcome or exact Fiber `endMessageId` with
answered calls). It then enters the normal `noteGoalTurn()` path, using the bound local turn id or
stable `g-resume-<commandId>` only when no live generation id ever existed. A manual second user
turn, navigation away, an already-owned Goal draft/turn, unusable Goal policy, or successful claim
consumes the hint. Reopening old resumed history therefore cannot synthesize fresh Goal work. The
sessionStorage row is same-tab provenance across content-script reload, nothing more; continuation,
session metadata and the durable Goal reply ledger remain the authorities.

**Tests.** `continuation.test.ts`, `resume.test.ts`. Current integration coverage repeatedly proves
objective A→B projection/recovery, while per-chat switch movement is only unit-covered by Goal tests;
there is no dedicated continuation/restart regression for `moveGoalSwitch()` yet. Add that contract
when touching this projection rather than assuming the parallel objective tests cover it.

## 16. Multi-agent — `agents.ts`

Experimental, enabled on fresh installs while existing configs preserve their stored choice,
**one global active execution run at a time**, star topology:
`worker ← prime → worker`. Workers never message each other.

**Identity.** The prime is the conversation that successfully called `agents action=spawn`
with proven caller identity. Worker slots are opened by the app through browser bootstrap;
once the page has a real conversation id the extension reports it and the broker binds that
exact conversation before normal worker work proceeds. **Conversation identity is the
routing credential** — established from the same evidence as recorder attribution — so no
secret token rides in model arguments and **sender identity never comes from a model
argument**. There is no credential and no recovery action: a worker whose binding was lost
is rebound by the extension reporting its chat, never by something a model can present.

**Messaging is at-least-once until acknowledged**: queued durably → offered on a tool result
→ acknowledged by the next authenticated tool call. Offering on a result is **not** proof
the model received it. Never delete a message merely because it was offered.

**The broker state machine is semantic, not cosmetic.** `AgentState` currently has seven values:

| State | Meaning | Slot? | How it leaves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `invited` | worker row accepted/durable; fresh worker bootstrap has not yet bound a real ChatGPT conversation | yes | extension binds exact conversation → `active`; bootstrap failure → `failed` |
| `active` | worker conversation is bound and may be running/receiving MCP work | yes | browser view disappears → `detached`; natural/explicit stop → `sleeping` or ceiling-driven `finished`; hard failure → `failed` |
| `detached` | browser view is gone but the server-side ChatGPT turn may still be alive | yes | **page/new-turn** evidence may prove the browser side exists again → `active`; an exact MCP call only refreshes server-side liveness and deliberately stays `detached`; durable quiescence after detach → `sleeping`/`finished` |
| `waking` | prime message to a sleeper crossed broker durability and reserved a slot; browser revival is in flight | yes | **before browser custody**, exact call/genuinely newer turn may prove the wake unnecessary; **after redeem/send custody**, a subsequent exact authenticated MCP call or a turn that begins after the sleep, with delivered-revival evidence, proves `active`; between claim and send nothing does; no stop observed from outside (browser final, late finish call, quiet sweep) applies while waking; revival failure/timeout → `sleeping` |
| `sleeping` | worker stopped normally, exact conversation/history retained, revivable below ceiling | **no** | prime message reserves a slot → `waking`; late exact new-turn evidence may reactivate |
| `finished` | terminal context-ceiling retirement | no | never |
| `failed` | terminal failure/fence | no | never as ordinary reuse; recovery code may canonicalize only from positive authority |

`occupiesSlot()` is the single slot rule: `invited|active|detached|waking`. Do not equate "tab is
open" with active, or "tab is closed" with sleeping. A ChatGPT turn executes remotely and can keep
issuing correlated MCP calls after its page disappeared.

High-value transition symbols inside `agents.ts`:

| Transition / projection | Owner symbol |
| --- | --- |
| fresh exact worker chat binds `invited → active` | `bindConversation()` → private `activateWorker()` |
| browser view disappears `active → detached` | `workerConversationGone()` |
| exact authenticated evidence proves worker live again | `noteAgentAlive()` is source-sensitive: page/newer-turn evidence can clear `detached`; an exact call from a detached worker proves only server-side liveness and leaves it detached. After delivery, the woken chat's first exact call or a turn that starts after the sleep completes `waking → active`; the page alone never does |
| stopped worker becomes reusable/terminal | only from `active`/`detached` (`canStop()`): a stop landing on a `waking` row is the old turn's and is ignored. browser final: bridge `/events` → `stageWorkerConversationFinish()`; maintenance paths that already know the id use `sleepWorker()` or `sleepSilentDetachedWorkers()` → private `sleepAgent()`; context ceiling turns the same stop into `finished`. Exported `sleepWorkerConversation()` currently has no production caller and is not a jump-point |
| detached worker ages out | `sleepSilentDetachedWorkers()`; the four-minute detached silence belongs here, not to browser tab code |
| pending wake projection | `pendingWorkerRevivals()` |
| browser takes wake custody before text escapes | `claimWorkerRevival()`; flips the waking row from broker-revivable to browser-owned wake custody |
| ChatGPT accepted the revived user message | `noteWorkerRevived()`; records delivered message ids but deliberately leaves state `waking` |
| wake fails/deadline expires | `failWorkerRevival()` → `sleeping` with the queued prime message still owed; the **second** failed wake with no sign of life from that chat in between (`WAKE_FAILURES_BEFORE_GIVING_UP`, counted per worker conversation, reset by `noteAgentAlive()`) → `failAgent(revivable)`: the prime is told to spawn a replacement and not to retry, the inbox is kept, and the chat calling in again brings the worker back |
| parked prime history becomes live again | `reactivateDormantRunForConversation()` (kernel ingress, parked sleeping worker's proven call only) → private `reactivateDormantRun()`; identity lookup alone never reactivates it |

These functions are downstream of the staged production mutations in `tools-core.ts`; do not call
the convenience broker wrappers and assume their browser/durability ordering is the MCP contract.

**Broker durability precedes browser side effects.** Spawn, message-to-sleeper and finish use
staged unpublished state and an immediate critical swarm snapshot before the browser is asked to
open/type or before a report is published. If that durable write fails, the semantic mutation is
rolled back and a newer safe snapshot supersedes the rejected generation; `durable.ts` must never
later resurrect an operation the caller was told failed.

**Normal successful worker stops sleep instead of ending the worker.** `finish` normally reports a
result and puts a below-ceiling worker to *sleep*: it keeps its conversation, history and reusable
identity. Sleeping frees its worker slot, so `maxWorkers` counts **slot-occupying** workers
(`invited|active|detached|waking`), not every historical worker and not merely those visibly
"working" — a prime can create a new worker
while an older one sleeps and still wake that older worker afterwards. The same sleep happens without the tool call, from
durable evidence that the worker stopped, but never on the first quiet sample: the bridge's
attached/observable quiescence path waits `STALE_SWARM_MS` (**2 minutes**) before sleeping it.
A detached worker has its own longer `DETACHED_SILENCE_MS` (**4 minutes**) measured from the newest
of detach time, exact last-seen evidence and the process's liveness floor. App restart resets that
floor to "now", so an old persisted timestamp cannot instantly retire a worker before this process
has had a chance to re-observe it. Hard bootstrap/transport/broker failure may instead make the row
terminally `failed`; sleep is the normal-success path, not a guarantee for every ending.

**Ownership outlives the active run.** When no worker occupies a slot, the active incarnation is
parked immediately and the one global execution claim is released. Its complete agent map becomes
a durable history keyed by the prime conversation: sleeping workers, terminal/non-revivable rows,
their exact ChatGPT conversation bindings, queued prime reports and monotonically allocated
`worker-N` history all remain. Another prime may now start its own active incarnation, including
its own same-named `worker-1`, without seeing or mutating the first prime's history. Caller-scoped
`status` always returns the history owned by that prime, even while somebody else owns the active
execution slot. A dormant prime may spawn a fresh worker without reviving a sleeper; waking an old
worker reactivates that owner's history only when the global execution slot is free. So does a
proven tool call from a parked *sleeping, revivable* worker: `kernel.ts::dispatchTracked` calls
`reactivateDormantRunForConversation()` before `noteAgentAlive()`, which then revives the worker
exactly as it would inside a live run ("it never actually stopped"). Parking happens the moment
the last worker is thought asleep, so without this the last worker of every run was refused
`WORKER_SLEEPING` mid-turn for the very calls that revive any of its siblings (six workers on
2026-09-01). A finished/failed worker, a prime's own calls, a family mid-handover, and a family
whose slot another prime owns never reactivate; those keep the `WORKER_SLEEPING`/`WORKER_ENDED`
fences. Parked history is bounded: `pruneDormantRuns()` (on every park and on restore) drops
families older than `DORMANT_RUN_TTL_MS` (seven days) or beyond the newest `MAX_DORMANT_RUNS`
(sixteen), never one with an open transfer, and turns their worker chats into ordinary
retired-worker leases — every family is scanned per unattributed call and makes it wait the
identity-evidence window, and three days of runs had left twenty-nine on disk. Explicit
swarm clear is different from parking: it retires the worker conversation fences and discards the
retained histories. Turning Multi-agent **off is not Clear**: it stops/withdraws live execution,
parks the owner history, and keeps that history durable through disabled app restarts so re-enable
can still show and revive the exact old worker conversations.

**Chrome auto-discard protection is a derived browser policy, never agent liveness.**
`bridge.ts::nonDiscardableAgentConversations()` projects only the active Prime plus Workers in
`active|waking|detached` through `/status`. `background.js::maintain()` applies
`chrome.tabs.update({autoDiscardable:false})` to exact matching tabs and records a tab id in
`discardProtectedTabs` **only when this extension changed Chrome's policy itself**. That ownership
marker lives in `storage.session`; when the conversation stops qualifying or the tab closes, the
service worker restores `autoDiscardable:true` only for markers it owns. A tab already protected by
the user/browser is never claimed and therefore never “restored” behind their back. Sleeping and
terminal workers are not protected.

**Tab closing requires terminal authority.** `bridge.ts::browserTabPolicy()` retains waiting
ordinary chats and reusable sleeping workers, regardless of worker-slot capacity or idle time.
Two minutes of inactivity permits retirement only for terminal non-revivable workers, blocked
chats and cancelled dedicated work. A late-confirmed cancelled desktop new-chat send may retire,
but a later delivered follow-up supersedes that cancellation. Superseded sources and redundant
document copies remain separately eligible. Fresh document, journal, draft and generation checks
still gate every close. New owned windows use at most 45% of the work area, capped at 800×600,
then minimize without a geometry update. Existing background windows are reused without changing
their state or geometry; a temporary planner stays until its replacement is established.
Model discovery retains its elected empty helper and transfers that exact tab to the first
authored input after fresh empty-document proof. The old discovery owner records that handout,
so a user-closed or navigated helper cannot regain opening authority. Browser process count is
not the window-ownership invariant.
This keeps live agent pages resident; it does not prove a turn
active, revive a worker or authorize a browser repair.

**Waking is messaging.** `agents action=message` to a sleeping worker reserves a free slot
inside the same durable barrier that queues the message, and only after that commit does the
browser get asked for anything. The bridge then creates a durable `revive` command naming the
worker's exact `conversationId`, but **the app does not elect or open the worker tab itself**.
That decision belongs to the extension service worker, because only its tab/conversation registry
can prove whether the exact worker chat is already open.

The wake path is:

```text
prime message → broker sleeping→waking + queued inbox row → immediate durable swarm barrier
  → bridge creates durable revive command
  → `/activity` exposes only the revival marker; actual prime text remains app-side
  → background.js persists/replays `deferredRevivals` and queries Chrome's current ChatGPT tabs
  → sort every exact-conversation tab by tab id and try `restoreChatgptTab()` deterministically
       → first repairable exact tab gets the marker
       → an exact tab still loading blocks replacement and is retried later
       → only positive proof that no exact tab is usable/starting authorizes ONE replacement `/c/<id>?clf=<command>#clf=<command>`
  → content waits for a submit-ready current document and recorder-flush fence
  → content redeems the bridge command, receives the exact text, types a genuine user message
  → irreversible send ACK enters service-worker custody
  → broker keeps the worker `waking` until the woken chat proves it is running: its first exact authenticated MCP call, or a turn beginning after the sleep
```

No free slot means the send-to-sleeper is refused outright — no inbox row is accepted and nothing
is typed. A failed browser send or the revival deadline (`REVIVAL_DEADLINE_MS` undelivered,
`REVIVAL_ACTIVITY_MS` after a proven delivery) puts the worker back to
`sleeping`, returns the slot and leaves the prime's row queued for a later explicit wake — once. The
second failed wake in a row, with nothing heard from that chat between them, is the verdict on the
chat: `failWorkerRevival()` fails the worker revivably and tells the prime to spawn a replacement
rather than try again (2026-09-03: worker-7's conversation answered every load with "This content is
unavailable"; four wakes each waited out their deadline and each told the prime to retry, thirty
minutes before it spawned the replacement). Any first-hand word from the chat resets the count. A
successful browser `sent` ACK is stronger than an ordinary offer because ChatGPT accepted the user
message, but it is **not** proof the worker reacted: the revive command remains leased and the
broker remains `waking` until exact worker activity — the first call, or the turn that begins after the sleep — resolves that second boundary. The page re-reporting the settled answer that put the worker to sleep is not a stop: `canStop()` refuses every stop on a `waking` row (2026-09-02: that replay slept two just-woken workers and retired their wake commands while the typed message ran unowned).

Duplicate exact worker tabs are therefore **not** resolved by guessing one current page and they
are not an automatic hard refusal either. `background.js::recoverDeferredRevivals()` owns the
deterministic election; `restoreChatgptTab()` first health-pings the existing content script and
repairs its Fiber helper, otherwise re-injects DOM/Fiber/content/CSS into that exact tab. Only an
unrecoverable/no-usable exact-tab result permits the one authorized replacement branch; a merely
loading exact tab means “wait”, not
“open another”. `/commands/redeem` remains the final one-page lease authority even if Chrome still
contains duplicate views of the same conversation.

There is one **current fail-open hole in that election**. `recoverDeferredRevivals()` catches a
`chrome.tabs.query()` failure by assigning `tabs=[]`; the loop then interprets “browser truth was
unavailable” as “no exact tab exists” and may create the one replacement, duplicating a worker that
was actually open. `maintain()` already gets this boundary right for recovery and simply returns on
query failure. Revival must do the same: leave the durable deferred marker pending/retryable and open
nothing until a real tab scan proves absence. Do not add duplicate cleanup after the fact. The old
comments in `extension.test.ts` that say “the app opens the marked chat” are stale too — production
tab election/opening is service-worker-owned as described above.

Once `/commands/redeem` gives the browser custody of a wake, a late call from the worker is no
longer allowed to reinterpret that exact wake as unnecessary. Conversely, before redeem, exact
worker liveness may prove the old turn never stopped and cancel the inferred sleep. **Positive
identity/liveness outranks inferred lifecycle.** A mere open sleeping page is not enough; an exact
authenticated call or a genuinely newer turn is enough only in that pre-custody arbitration window.
After browser custody, a page heartbeat still cannot complete the wake; once the send is ACKed, either
an exact authenticated MCP call or a turn beginning after the sleep moves `waking → active`, because the
turn is the earlier proof and the only one that survives a late request-id join. In the claimed-but-unsent
window neither does, so the page cannot be raced into typing the same words twice.

**The context ceiling is what makes an otherwise normal stop permanently `finished`.** A worker becomes terminally `finished` when its chat
reaches `WORKER_CONTEXT_CEILING_TOKENS` (400k), measured from the app's own durable session
summary — never from a model-carried counter. Crossing it does **not** interrupt work in
flight; it makes the *next* stop permanent. Workers **never Compact & Resume themselves**,
automatically or manually: the worker conversation is the agent identity, so no threshold may
open a replacement worker chat. Because workers outlive their tabs and their
prime's tab, closing the prime chat pauses the run instead of ending it: the user comes back,
the prime resumes, and the same workers are still there.

That ceiling is revalidated on the **model-facing agents entrypoint**, not only by browser
telemetry. `tools-core.ts::measureSleepingWorkers()` runs before `agents message` may wake a sleeper
**and before `agents status` returns state**. It re-reads each sleeping worker's exact durable
session `contextTokens`, feeds that into `agents.ts::noteAgentContextTokens()`, then requires
`persistCriticalSwarmNow()` to cross disk before the result is published. A worker whose chat grew
past 400k while the app was down can therefore become `finished` during what looks like a status
read. `status` is not semantically read-only at this boundary: it is the production remeasurement
that makes revocation of revival authority survive restart. If that critical swarm write fails, the
agents call fails rather than reporting the worker revivable after failing to durably revoke it.

This does not make `finished` the only terminal state: `failed` is the separate hard-failure fence
for a bootstrap/transport/broker failure that cannot safely remain revivable. Both are terminal to
ordinary model routing; only their reason differs.

**Finish and cleanup.** `finish` is idempotent; final worker output routes to the exact prime
conversation even if parking happens on that same finish. Once no worker holds a slot, the active
incarnation releases immediately; pending reports remain in the dormant prime's inbox and retain
the same at-least-once offer/ack semantics. Dormant worker conversations remain authority fences,
including terminal rows, so stale tabs cannot fall through as ordinary unidentified chats while a
different prime is active. Orphan cleanup uses durable quiescence plus the wider in-flight
MCP/observation counters — not a heartbeat guess. Compact & Resume moves active **or dormant**
prime ownership together with session/workspace state; normal commit and recovery repair transfer
the same complete worker history to the child conversation or move nothing.

**Tests.** `agents.test.ts`, `swarm.test.ts`; the revival's browser half is in
`bridge.test.ts`, `extension.test.ts` and `content-script.test.ts`.

## 17. Renderer, IPC, connection and desktop
### Astra finish continuation and durable input

`session/finish.ts` owns the exact active conversation/turn finish boundary. `session_finish` is
for Astra when explicitly requested by the user prompt; worker completion still uses
`agents action=finish`. Planning helpers receive only task content. Finish reminders are attached
at delivery, independently of plan text, and hidden from the app's authored prompt display.
Browser and tool delivery share `shared/finish.ts::finishInstruction()`: complete the requested
implementation before calling with the configured 3/5 minutes of final verification remaining.
New instructions extend the task and do not each require another finish call. HELD responses use
the same policy; empty holds still allow waiting via session_finish without invented work.

Plans deliver one stage directly in a successful finish-tool return, or after a verified completed
turn for ordinary chats. Ordinary tool injections may stack and share the next tool response;
normal browser sends retain one exclusive delivery claim. `session/input.ts` owns those distinctions,
receipts and cancellation. Tool-intent input has no claim-age timeout; actual turn/settings changes
can cancel generated instructions. Legacy periodic generated rows are retired and cannot revive.

For Astra, both Goal and Loop use the Loop prompt and tool injection: an actual completed answer
never starts another automatic browser message. `goal.ts::astraFinishOnly()` guards ordinary Goal
acceptance/generation and bridge routes. Pending user/plan instructions take priority. The shared
`automaticFinishEnabled()` authority decides both production and queued-input validity: an armed
chat Goal/Loop suppresses Notify even when global finish action is Notify. A resulting instruction
arrives on a later tool call, with the normal generating animation while it is being drafted.
The empty-queue notification/manual action remains scoped to the exact held turn.

`automaticCompactionAllowed()` excludes exact selected Pro models independently of the saved
auto-compaction setting. The composer context meter shows estimated current-chat tokens, not a
provider-reported count; Pro has a static ring, while other models show configured utilization.


**Goal + Loop.** `goal.ts` is one LLM engine with two standing modes and one optional
per-chat objective: OpenRouter by default, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
(`goal.provider`). It sends only authored user messages and final assistant answers to the
provider; tool rows, native progress and hidden reasoning stay out of that transcript. That provider
view comes from the **local canonical recording**, not the live page. `goal.ts::
conversationMessages()` keeps final assistant revisions only, coalesces duplicate legacy final
snapshots by stable message id, clips each row to 12k chars and bounds the final context to 120
messages / 120k chars. A saturated tail is not allowed to forget what the conversation is for:
before filling newest history backwards it reserves the actual first user request and the newest
**committed** Compact & Resume bootstrap reconstructed from durable handoff provenance. Uncommitted
or stale handoffs never become a model-context anchor merely because matching text is visible. The
fresh baseline is **off**, mode **`goal`**, model **`z-ai/glm-5.3`**, reasoning `default`; existing
user selections remain verbatim. Goal and Loop default to the ChatGPT backend with GPT-5.6 Sol High; the API model above applies only when API is selected. `shared/types.ts::GoalSettings` is the contract and
`config.ts::DEFAULT_GOAL` is the fresh/repair default.

The standing switches are **one setting**, not two booleans: `goal.enabled` says whether the
OpenRouter driver is armed and `goal.mode` is `'goal' | 'loop'`. `goal.ts::applyGoalSwitch()` is
the pure mode transition used by both bridge-scoped and app-wide writes: turning one on enables that
exact mode; turning the currently running one off disables the driver but leaves the preferred
`mode` remembered. The bridge owns whether that reducer is applied to a concrete chat override or
the New Chat/global default; the reducer does not own routing. A worker chat is
always excluded by `goalWorkerChat()` because its user turns already belong to the prime — in
**any** state: `agents.ts::isWorkerConversation()` sees active, parked, finished and failed workers,
and `retiredWorkerForConversation()` keeps the fence after the run. The owner lookup
(`agentForOwnedConversation()`) deliberately forgets a worker that is over and must not be used as
this fence: on 2026-09-03 two ceiling-finished workers passed it, auto-compaction filed tickets a
worker page can never discharge, and reloaded each page five times before giving up. The same
`goalFencedChat()` guards `considerAutomaticCompaction()`. A chat
with a stored objective is active even when the standing switch is off, but then
`goal.ts::goalDrivingMode()` deliberately falls back to **Goal**, never inherits Loop: a mode that
cannot stop must be an explicit choice. "Explicit" means the switch **or** the mode the goal was
written under — the sheet's two links post `mode` with the goal and the bridge pins it as that
chat's own switch in the same request. That second door exists because the first one cost a run:
a goal saved from the New Chat sheet starts the chat immediately, the standing switch there is the
app-wide default rather than anything about this chat, and an unattended run started from "add
specific goal" ended two turns in on one "looks done" from the gate. Never widen the fallback to
inherit Loop instead; the fix is that the choice travels with the goal, not that a missing choice
guesses.

There are **three** editable persisted instructions, all bounded at config/IPC:

- `goal.prompt` — the ordinary **gate**, used when no explicit chat objective exists. It decides
  whether the finished answer left concrete requested work unfinished.
- `goal.objectivePrompt` — the **driver** once that chat carries a specific goal/finish line.
- `goal.loopPrompt` — the **Loop** instruction, used instead of both while the standing mode is
  `loop`; if the chat also has an objective, that objective is supplied alongside the Loop prompt.

The shipped prompts are meta-prompter instructions: the model is sitting in the user's seat and
produces the next genuine user message. Goal has two semantic outcomes — continue with a message,
or stop / `NO_REPLY`; Loop has only one. `goal.ts::LOOP_RESPONSE_FORMAT` removes `stop` from the
provider schema itself (`action` can only be `continue`), and `requestDrivingDecision()` asks again
up to the fixed `LOOP_ATTEMPTS` bound if a provider response still tries to stop. Exhausting that
bound is a retryable draft failure, not permission to send an empty/fabricated message. The app-
owned output protocol and trailer sit after the editable prompt/transcript so a long conversation
cannot push the operative instruction entirely out of recency. Local validation remains final:
wrapped control tokens, malformed schema/reasoning payloads or an empty cleaned reply fail closed
before `humanReply()` or the browser sees sendable text.

All three read the requirements out of the user's own words and never out of ChatGPT's account of
them: in a long transcript that account is the nearer text and always the narrower one, because it
describes what got built rather than what was asked for. The driver and the Loop instruction say so
outright, tell the model to re-read the whole goal before every message, and explicitly license a
long, concrete message — the user's register governs how it writes, never how much of the
requirement it carries, and a bare "keep going" is named as a wasted turn. Loop alone may escalate,
since it is the only mode still talking after the job is done: each pass asks for more depth on the
same requirements. That licence is also the only way it can leave the job entirely, so the
direction is pinned in the wording — deeper into the user's brief, never sideways into a second
project. Keep both properties if you rewrite these; a loop that drifts off the brief burns the
whole night it was left running for.

The Goal **model picker** has its own narrow secret/network boundary. Renderer code never receives
the provider key and never fetches the catalogue directly: IPC `goal:models` accepts only a bounded
offset, fixes the page size at 20, and calls `goal.ts::listGoalModels()`. The main-process catalogue
loader uses a 30-second request ceiling, 8 MiB response bound and 5,000-model parse cap, sorts newest
releases first, and caches for five minutes **scoped to a SHA-256 fingerprint of the current API
key** (or the public/no-key bucket) **plus the endpoint URL**. A key or endpoint change therefore cannot reuse a restricted catalogue from
the previous credential. A custom endpoint that answers no usable catalogue yields an empty
list and the model stays a hand-typed field. `renderer/chat.ts::loadGoalModels()` / `paintGoalModels()` /
`maybePageGoalModels()` own scroll-paged presentation only; load failure leaves the user's current
model selection untouched.

An untouched persisted copy of any superseded shipped Goal default migrates to the current
default; customized text stays exact. That holds for all three, each with its own list in
`shared/goal.ts` and all three walked by `config.ts::adoptCurrentGoalPrompt()` — for a while only
the gate had one, which would have stranded every existing install on a superseded driver or Loop
instruction the moment those constants moved. Ship a prompt change and its list entry together. Changing a prompt/mode retires incompatible drafts so one in-flight
decision never mixes old and new policy. Terminal Goal/Loop cards persist only as presentation for
the exact finished turn; dismissal and navigation are conversation-scoped and async paint stays
navigation-epoch fenced.

**A chat's own switch.** Goal/Loop `enabled`+`mode` is stored per exact conversation in the durable
`goal-switches` ledger (`goal.ts::goalSwitchFor/setGoalSwitchNow`), and the app-wide `config.goal`
pair is the **default a chat inherits when it has no row of its own**. A composer always knows its
conversation, so `/settings` with a `conversationId` writes that chat's override and never the
app-wide setting; only a New Chat (no id yet) moves the global default. This is what makes a runaway
loop stoppable without stopping every other chat: while its override exists, ordinary global config
changes do not rewrite it. The app's own settings switch making an explicit **enabled→disabled**
transition is different: it is the master “stop everything” action and `ipc.ts` calls
`clearAllGoalSwitches()`, intentionally putting every chat back under the now-off global default.
Turning the app-wide setting on does not itself delete/overwrite rows that still exist, but after a
master-Off has cleared them a later On naturally applies to those chats again. Compact & Resume moves
an existing override A→B beside the objective, so a running loop keeps its exact per-chat choice in
the replacement chat.

There is one **current durability asymmetry** here; do not document it away or add a recovery layer
around it. A composer-scoped switch crosses `goal.ts::setGoalSwitchNow()` and awaits
`writeDurableNow(goal-switches)` before the page is told success. The renderer's app-wide master-Off
first durably saves `config.json`, then calls synchronous `clearAllGoalSwitches()`, whose persistence
is only the 300 ms debounced `writeDurableSoon()` path. Clean shutdown drains that debounce via
`flushDurable()`, but an abrupt process loss in the gap can restart with global Goal Off **and old
per-chat enabled overrides restored**; `goalSwitchFor()` currently prefers an own row even while the
global default is off. This is one logical policy mutation split across two durable owners. The root
fix is to put the standing-switch authority — **global default plus per-chat overrides** — behind one
Goal-owned durable mutation/acceptance owner so master-Off is one committed state transition, not two
files that must be guessed back together. Neither half may become restart-authoritative by itself.
Do not paper over a torn transition with startup cleanup, another stop flag or a watchdog.

Draft retirement has the same **acceptance-boundary problem plus a scope bug**, and it is not limited
to renderer settings. Renderer `settings:save` durably commits `config.json` before synchronous
`retireGoalDrafts()`; replacing the OpenRouter credential durably writes the new encrypted secret
before the same retirement. Browser-scoped `/goal/objective` and `/settings` do the equivalent thing
for one chat: `setGoalObjectiveNow()` / `setGoalSwitchNow()` first make the new chat policy durable,
then `retireGoalDraftsFor()` changes its reply ledger only through the debounced writer. A hard loss
in any of those gaps can therefore restore a **new policy/key with an old pending obligation**.
Separately, renderer global-default enabled/mode changes **and** unscoped New-Chat `/settings` changes
call `retireGoalDrafts()` for **every** chat,
even a conversation whose own `goal-switches` row leaves its effective mode unchanged. The unaffected
set is broader than overrides: an objective-driven chat whose standing switch is off deliberately
drives in Goal mode, so changing only the remembered global mode also leaves its effective draft
policy unchanged. Raw `config.goal` before/after is therefore not a retirement scope.

The deeper bug is that `retireGoalDrafts*()` currently conflates two different decisions:
**invalidate this in-memory provider attempt** and **semantically discharge/supersede this durable
reply obligation**. Split those concepts at the Goal owner. A draft is frozen to one conversation's
effective mode/objective/model/prompt/reasoning/credential and must be aborted when that effective
instruction changes; an unrelated global default must not touch an overriding chat. But aborting an
attempt does **not** by itself mean the final assistant reply was answered: repairing a key/model or
other provider setting must be able to leave the same obligation pending for a fresh attempt. Only a
policy operation that explicitly means “this existing reply is no longer owed a Goal decision” may
mark it handled/superseded, and then that ledger transition must cross the **same durable acceptance
boundary** as the policy change that decided it. App-wide enabled→off is the deliberate master-stop
case. Do not repair torn stores with replay daemons, startup cleanup or blanket tombstone rewrites.

There is a separate **current runtime-gate hole when recording is off**. `config.ts` forces the
app-wide `config.goal.enabled=false` when `sessions.record=false`, but durable per-chat switches and
objectives remain independent. `bridge.ts::goalEnabledFor()` / `goalActiveFor()` do not check
recording; when the bridge remains alive for another owner such as Multi-agent, `/activity` can
therefore still project an actionable objective/override, and
`content.js::goalUsable()` can request `/goal/draft` against an already-recorded session. Inside
`acceptGoalReplyNow()` the same call is simultaneously classified `handled` because
`sessions.record=false`, yet `beginGoalDraft()` still starts provider work. The privacy/runtime
invariant is simpler: **Goal may not act at all while recording is off**, whatever per-chat policy is
stored. Put that condition in the one effective Goal-runtime gate used by projection, draft routes and
watchdog; keep the stored objective/switch as dormant user state rather than clearing it or adding
page-side special cases.

**The sheet repaints only when it changes.** `content.js::renderMenu()` builds the whole sheet from
`settingsView()`, so it serialises that view plus the three page-local pieces it does not carry
(`menuBusy`, `objectiveBusy`, `objectiveError`) and returns without touching the DOM when the result
matches what is on screen; only the sheet's position is re-decided. The draft text is deliberately
outside that signature — the textarea already holds it and the input listener keeps Save in step —
so typing a goal repaints nothing. This is not an optimisation: the activity tick calls
`renderControl()` once a second, and an unconditional rebuild replaced the node the pointer was
resting on, so the hover explainer on "add specific goal" blinked out and returned on its 350 ms
delay for ever, and no text anywhere in the sheet could be selected for longer than a tick. A
genuine change still rebuilds, which is why the caret, focus and scroll position of an open goal
editor are carried across by hand.

**No cap on a goal's length.** A specific goal is a brief somebody writes; it is stored whole and
was never truncated visibly, so a 4,000-character cut was silent data loss. `/goal/objective` and
`/goal/open` are bounded only by `MAX_BODY_BYTES`, the same transport rule as every other route.

**A chat's own goal.** The composer control exists in a New Chat too (`content.js::injectControl`),
because a goal written there may become that chat's first user message; compaction remains
unavailable until a real conversation exists. The sheet offers the goal as **two** links — "add
specific goal" and "add specific loop" — and which one opened the editor is the mode posted with
the text. Above a New Chat those links are the whole control: `content.js::settingsView()` drops
the Goal and Loop switch rows there (`scope: 'new'`, taken from `composerChat()`, i.e. the route
and never the id this tab is still holding), because a switch with no chat to belong to moves the
app-wide default while the goal beside it starts a chat — two scopes reading as one decision. In a
real chat both switches stay: they are the only way to drive a chat carrying no goal, and the only
way to switch a running loop off. `/goal/objective` stores one objective per exact conversation in
the durable `goal-objectives` ledger, separate from global config, and when the page named a mode
it writes that chat's `goal-switches` row **first**, so no poll ever sees a goal whose mode the
standing switch could still answer for. Clearing the goal with a mode switches that chat off again:
writing the goal is what armed it. Production POST
acceptance goes through `goal.ts::setGoalObjectiveNow()`, which crosses the immediate durable write
before the bridge reports success. The similarly named synchronous `setGoalObjective()` is a
convenience/test path with only debounced persistence; do not use it as the browser acceptance
boundary. Reopening a chat restores the text but never creates a new draft from an old finished
turn. `bridge.ts::goalActiveFor()`
arms that chat from either the standing switch or the objective; the worker fence overrides both.
With an objective, Goal uses the explicit finish line instead of the generic continuation gate.
Loop keeps looping but is given the same objective as context — **Loop does not declare success and
stop when the objective is reached**; ending it remains the human's switch decision. A Goal-mode
decision that the objective is reached stops the current run while leaving the objective stored
until the user clears/replaces it. Compact & Resume moves that objective A→B as part of the same
projection repair as session/workspace/swarm state.

`/goal/open` covers the one moment with no conversation id yet. It does not persist an anonymous
objective or stream a draft into nowhere: the page awaits the opening message, sends it through the
real composer, then binds the objective once ChatGPT creates the concrete conversation.
Transient provider/opening failures carry the same Goal-owned `retryable` classification as an
ordinary draft; the page retries the opening on the same unbounded `GOAL_RETRY_MS` clock as an
in-chat turn, only while it still proves the same empty New Chat holding the same goal — a rate
limit outlives any short courtesy pause, and there is no later turn to retry from. Settled
key/account/model failures and a model refusing to write the opening remain
terminal, and no app-side retry continues after the page navigates away.
This is the one extension→app request allowed to outlive the ordinary 10-second bridge request
deadline: `background.js` gives it `MODEL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS = 190s`, deliberately just beyond
`goal.ts`'s own 180-second OpenRouter request ceiling. A local request timeout returns a retryable
error **without forgetting the paired bridge port** — the port answered and only the model work was
slow. Every ordinary transport failure still invalidates the discovered port. Keep those two facts
separate or a slow model completion turns into pointless bridge rediscovery while the paid provider
request continues with nobody left to receive it.

**Turn outcomes Goal/Loop may answer.** The current page contract is deliberately narrow:
`GOAL_CONTINUABLE = {'completed'}`. `stopped` is the user's own decision; `interrupted`, `failed`,
`stalled` and `unknown` are recovery/turn-integrity states with no trusted final answer to feed the
meta-prompter. Do not widen this set because partial prose looks useful — a Goal message typed into
or after an unfinished response becomes a real user correction. If product policy later chooses to
continue an interrupted answer, that requires a new explicit terminal-answer proof and regression
on both `content.js` and the recorder/Goal durable obligation, not just adding a string to the set.

The page then applies an **eight-second four-signal settle** before it asks the app: final answer
text stable, native/tool activity stable, ChatGPT generating control absent, and app-reported
`runningToolCalls()` zero. The five-minute watch ceiling gives up visibly rather than converting
ambiguity into a send. Retryable OpenRouter failures wait 15 seconds **outside** the Goal busy lock;
holding the lock while sleeping would make a different turn that ends during the wait miss its
only trigger edge.

The exact Goal/Loop ownership chain is worth following once:

```text
content.js::finishGeneration
  → noteGoalTurn(completed, exact local turn id)
  → watchGoalTurn() holds the 8s four-signal settle
  → /goal/draft
  → bridge validates exact chat/client + durable pending reply
  → goal.ts::startGoalDraft() freezes mode/model/prompts/objective for this turn
  → beginGoalDraft() → requestDrivingDecision() → requestGoalDecision()
       → OpenRouter non-streaming strict JSON-schema completion (`stream:false`)
       → response-healing + `provider.require_parameters` → bounded `readGoalCompletion()`
  → /activity returns sending/answering/ready|no-reply|failed
  → content.js::maybeSendGoalReply()
       ready: reserve composer → send genuine user message → remember spent token → /goal/ack
       no-reply: send nothing → /goal/ack
       retryable failure: /goal/ack old attempt → 15s page-side retry of the same durable turn
  → goal.ts marks the reply obligation handled only for ready/no-reply
```

This split is deliberate. `goal.ts` owns provider work and durable idempotency; the **page owns
whether acting is still safe** because only it can see navigation, a newer generation, the user's
typed composer text and current ChatGPT liveness. Provider retries therefore do not live in a
background retry daemon. `requestDrivingDecision()` internally retries only Loop's invalid attempt
to stop, up to `LOOP_ATTEMPTS = 3`; ordinary transient provider failures return to the page as
`retryable` and are retried only while the same exact turn is still current. The current provider
contract is deliberately **non-streaming** because OpenRouter response healing requires a complete
structured response. The retained SSE parser/`answering` publication path is compatibility for
legacy streaming-shaped responses, not the production request mode and not a reason to reintroduce
streaming Goal decisions.

Goal/Loop share three durable ledgers and one memory draft map:

- `goal-objectives`: per-chat objective text. Restore shows it; restore never starts a draft.
- `goal-switches`: per-chat `{enabled, mode, at}` override of the app-wide switch, bounded to 400
  conversations (oldest decision evicted). Absent means "follow `config.goal`"; a row never expires,
  because an override is a decision rather than an observation.
- `goal-replies`: one stable assistant reply obligation per conversation, `{replyId, turnId,
  eventSeq, acceptedAt, pending|handled}`. The recorder persists this decision before HTTP success,
  so page reload/app restart cannot lose a terminal answer that was owed one Goal decision. The
  ledger is bounded to 200 conversations and 12 hours from `acceptedAt`; that prevents restoration
  from turning an old finished chat into a standing invitation to type tomorrow.

The Goal ledgers have a separate **current semantic-mutation serialization hole**. `durable.ts`
serializes file publication, but `setGoalObjectiveNow()`, `setGoalSwitchNow()` and especially
`acceptGoalReplyNow()` mutate shared in-memory maps, capture whole-ledger snapshots, await
`writeDurableNow()`, then roll back on failure **without a Goal-side mutation queue**. Two different
chats can therefore overlap: B can capture A's staged-but-not-yet-accepted value in its successful
snapshot, while A later fails and queues a rollback snapshot; a crash between those publications can
resurrect an operation A was told failed. `acceptGoalReplyNow()` is stronger still because its
failure rollback clears/rebuilds the whole reply map. File-write serialization is not semantic
transaction serialization. The root fix is one **serialized copy-on-write mutation owner per Goal
ledger**: derive `next` from the latest committed live ledger, write `next` first for an immediate
acceptance boundary, and publish it to readers only after that write succeeds. Failure then leaves the
old live state untouched — no rollback path exists to race. Debounced moves/clears must enter the same
ordering so an older snapshot cannot overtake a newer accepted one. Regress “A write fails while B
succeeds” and prove neither rejected state becomes temporarily actionable nor either caller's final
state overwrites the other.

There is a **current provisional-row restore bug** inside that ledger. `/goal/draft` may have to
freeze the semantic obligation before Fiber/recorder exposes the stable assistant id, so it durably
writes `replyId='turn:<localTurnId>'` with `eventSeq=0`. A later stable candidate upgrades that same
row while preserving its original `acceptedAt` and `pending|handled` state. But
`restoreGoalReplies()` currently rejects every snapshot row with `eventSeq < 1`. A restart before the
stable-id upgrade therefore drops either a **pending** obligation or an already-**handled**
provisional tombstone; in the handled case a later replayed stable final can be accepted as fresh and
potentially trigger duplicate Goal continuation. The invariant is that provisional identity is a
real durable phase until strengthened. Restore must accept `eventSeq===0` **only** for the exact
provisional shape `replyId === 'turn:' + turnId`, preserve its original `acceptedAt` + state, and let
the existing stable-id upgrade strengthen that same row. Regression-test both pending and handled
restart cases; never recover by scanning rendered history for "the latest answer".
The Goal loop has exactly one trigger and it lives in the page: a content script sees a turn end and
asks for a draft. `bridge.ts::inspectOwedGoals()` is the app-side half of that; it consumes
`goal.ts::pendingGoalReplies()` and uses `goalDraftBusy()` only to distinguish an in-flight pickup
from a stalled one. The reason it
exists is that page liveness *is* loop liveness — a document that dies between the final answer and
the request leaves an obligation correctly `pending` with nobody alive to redeem it, which is exactly
what the live prime trace showed (reply at 21:56:46, the app first heard a Goal was owed at 22:00:33
when a human reloaded by hand). It reloads the chat on `GOAL_WATCH_BACKOFF_MS` — two minutes of
quiet, then 2/5/10/15 — and then stops for good. Load-bearing details:

- Attempts are **spent, never refunded**. Activity pushes the next attempt out (while tool calls
  arrive the chat is working, not stalled) but buys no further attempts, which is what makes the
  watchdog terminate whatever the page does with the reload — a schedule that reset on the page
  events a reload produces would be a chat reloading itself for ever.
- `goalWatchFloor` is set when the bridge starts serving, and an obligation accepted before it is
  never acted on. `goal-replies` is durable for twelve hours, which is right for a replacement
  content script asking what it still owes and quite wrong as a licence to reload yesterday's chats.
- A `sending`/`answering` draft counts as the pickup happening; a `ready` draft nobody types does
  not. An open continuation for the obligation's session suppresses the watchdog entirely, because
  Compact & Resume currently owns that session while the transaction is in flight. **Do not infer a
  Goal-reply migration from that suppression.** `continuation.ts::publishCommittedProjection()`
  explicitly moves the Goal objective and per-chat switch A→B, but there is currently no
  reply-ledger projection: `goal-replies` remains keyed by A. That is not neutral after commit.
  `continuationForSession()` stops suppressing a committed transaction; if A now inherits app-wide
  Goal On, `inspectOwedGoals()` can spend its bounded reload schedule reopening historical A even
  though the session has durably moved to B and `/goal/draft` can no longer resolve A as its current
  conversation. The semantic fix is **supersession, not migration**: by the time the continuation
  commits, the resume bootstrap is already the genuine next user message that made the old A reply
  no longer the turn awaiting a user decision, while B's first assistant answer has its own exact
  `resumeGoalPending` provenance. Make source-A reply supersession an idempotent part of the same
  committed projection used by normal commit and durable-B recovery. Do not teach the Goal watchdog
  or browser opener to special-case historical A. Regress that commit leaves no A Goal repair and
  that B's first answer still gets exactly its ordinary/recovered Goal edge.
- A failed draft leaves the obligation `pending` by design (`ackGoalDraft` discharges only on
  `ready`/`no-reply`), but **not every failure is immediately retryable**. For transient/provider
  failures outside `SETTLED_FAILURE`, the page ACKs that failed attempt and a same-turn
  `startGoalDraft()` may create a fresh attempt; this is the path the page retries after 15 seconds
  while the exact turn is still safe to act on. Settled account/settings failures
  (`auth_rejected`, `out_of_credit`, `unknown_model`, `no_api_key`, `no_conversation`,
  `no_objective`) return `retryable:false` and the acknowledged same-turn request keeps returning
  that failed draft instead of paying the provider again. The durable reply obligation remains
  pending in both cases. After the draft payload's 10-minute TTL, `expireDraftPayload()` clears the
  payload/error but preserves the idempotency tombstone; a later request may then become a fresh
  attempt, still against the same undischarged obligation.

- `drafts`: current OpenRouter work, one per conversation, frozen with its selected mode/prompt at
  creation; stage `sending|answering|ready|no-reply|failed`. In Goal mode `ready` and `no-reply` are
  the two semantic decisions. Loop may only finish as `ready`; a would-be stop becomes a bounded
  retry and then retryable failure. A settled draft payload is offered for 10 minutes, but that TTL
  expires the **payload**, not the durable reply obligation; only a real `ready` send or `no-reply`
  decision discharges the obligation.

**Renderer/IPC.** `renderer/main.ts` is setup/permissions/connection/activity;
`renderer/chat.ts` is session timeline, handoff, swarm. To add a capability: narrow
main-process action → validate in `ipc.ts` → expose exactly that method in
`preload/index.ts` → call it. **Never add a generic `invoke(method, args)` escape hatch.**
Async loads use generation counters so a slow load for session A cannot paint over the B the
user selected, and unsolicited state pushes must not clobber a focused unsaved form field.
Captured ChatGPT HTML is untrusted: `chat.ts::renderedMessage()` allowlists semantic tags,
strips attributes, drops executable/form/embed content and non-safe link schemes.
Text direction is automatic on prose blocks, chat titles, queued text and prose editors;
the app shell stays LTR. Lists/quotes and explicit captured `dir` values own their subtrees,
while code defaults to LTR. CSS uses logical list/quote edges and per-paragraph bidi for
plain messages. No language preference or direction watcher is required.
Tests: `ipc.test.ts`, `renderer-html.test.ts`, `renderer-layout.test.ts`, `renderer-state.test.ts`, `renderer-timeline.test.ts` (compaction card, stable rows).

Chats **Open Chat** is another example of the same narrow boundary. `renderer/chat.ts::sessionRow()`
draws the action only when the current session summary carries a `conversationId`, but the renderer
does not construct or trust a ChatGPT URL. Preload exposes only `openSessionChat(id)`; IPC
`sessions:openChat` re-reads that session from the store, validates the stored conversation id, then
calls `browser.ts::openInPreferredBrowser(chatUrl(id))`. An Unattributed/no-conversation session is
therefore not openable, and a renderer-supplied session id can never smuggle an arbitrary URL into
the browser opener.

`renderer/dom.ts` is the shared **presentation-only** helper boundary: `el()` always uses
`textContent`, `icon()` references the controlled SVG sprite, `run()` unwraps the fixed preload IPC
result and toasts main-process errors, and the remaining helpers format trusted timestamps/counts.
It owns no application state and deliberately contains no `innerHTML`; do not turn it into a second
renderer store or generic HTML rendering escape hatch.

Settings are a **multi-writer transaction**, not a blind renderer snapshot. The renderer sends
`{base, patch}` and `ipc.ts::mergeSettings()` performs a field-wise three-way merge against the
latest main-process config: a value unchanged from `base` was not edited by this form and keeps the
newer live value; only a field the renderer actually changed wins. This exists because the browser
extension can change Goal/Auto Compact while the app's settings sheet is open. A full-snapshot save
without the base would silently undo that newer browser-side choice.

The renderer separately protects **draft UI state** that is not config yet. A focused dirty input,
root-rename draft/caret, selected session and async load generation survive unsolicited whole-state
pushes/repaints. "Main process is authoritative" does not mean "throw away text the user has not
submitted." Every push path must distinguish persisted state from local draft state.

Renderer saves are serialized too. `renderer/main.ts` captures each full requested settings
snapshot from the latest **requested** state before queuing its IPC call; a slow response from save
N therefore cannot become the baseline that erases edits already captured for N+1. The renderer
queue and main-process three-way merge solve different races and both are required.

The desktop session UI has its **own** bounded read protocol; do not reuse the model-facing
`session` cursor design by assumption. `ipc.ts` session lists page by stable `(updatedAt,id)`
cursor, first detail load reads a recent tail, and incremental detail reads advance by monotonic
sequence. Deliberate upward scrolling near the top requests `before` pages in 80-row chunks;
downward navigation near the bottom requests `from` pages to recover evicted newer rows.
The retained window stays bounded at 160 rows, preserves its visible anchor in both directions
without bottom-following during pagination, and offers Back to latest. Reaching the forward tail
restores live delta reads.
Initial/layout scroll events do not drain history. The boundary comes from visible rows so a large final cannot hide earlier
history permanently; filtered-empty pages use the raw page boundary. Historical pages resist live
delta eviction while controls remain live, and async navigation is fenced by selection/load epoch.
`readRecentEvents` scans older pages in fixed chunks and retains only the requested rows.
`renderer/chat.ts` then caps one paint to 160 rows, about 2 MiB of text and 256 KiB of
captured rendered HTML. Those are presentation/read budgets only — the durable session store may
contain much more, and the model-facing session tool independently uses snapshot/update/detail
cursors for a different consumer.

Feature-toggle side effects have an order. Turning multi-agent off first parks/preserves broker
history, cancels worker browser commands while the bridge can still reach them, and crosses an
immediate durable authority barrier; only then may the bridge be stopped if recording is off too.
The settings write still applies connection/Desktop publication changes through the serialized
connection owner. A UI save must never report "off" while the durable worker authority it was
supposed to preserve failed to land.

**Connection and tunnel.** `connection.ts` owns local MCP server → Core publication →
optional Desktop publication → UI status, across the `openai`, `cloudflared` and `manual`
transports. On OpenAI tunnels **Core and Desktop need separate tunnel ids**, because the
connector UI addresses one tunnel id as one endpoint; on whole-origin transports both
tokenized paths share the origin. Lifecycle operations are serialized and generation ids
invalidate callbacks from replaced tunnels — reuse that for any new async status producer.
`tunnel/index.ts` supervises the child; `tunnel/health.ts` parses its `/metrics` and
`/api/status`. Runtime **startup readiness** and **verified external-link age** are deliberately
different facts. `/readyz` plus a **readable poll metric** is enough to call the freshly launched
client ready while its first long poll is still open; the first completed poll timestamp is the
stronger proof that OpenAI was actually reached. Once a timestamp exists, its freshness detects a
lost route. `/readyz` alone is never external-route proof because it stays green through an
internet outage, and one failed long poll is only a retry — an outage is complaints that outlive a
poll cycle without a newer verified timestamp. `diagnostics.ts` must preserve this distinction and
its bounded startup grace instead of forcing runtime readiness to wait for the first long poll.
Tests: `tunnel.test.ts`.

Tunnel restart ownership is generation-fenced inside `startOpenAiTunnel()`. The live child and all
of its mutable health/error state are one `ClientRun`; `current` names the only run whose callbacks
may publish. Every async health read/log/close/error path checks `current === run`. `restart(run,
...)` is the CAS-like cut: the first caller for that run clears current, serializes child-tree
retirement through the one `retirement` promise, and only after retirement may schedule `launch()`
for a successor. A late close/error from the old child therefore cannot race a health timeout into
two replacements or overwrite the new run's UI state. `routeObservation()` also returns
`unknown` only when the poll metric itself is unreadable; a readable metric with no handshake
timestamp is now `connected` for startup readiness, while `handshakeAt:null` still says the external
link has not yet been timestamp-verified. Do not add a second restart owner in diagnostics/connection code — they consume
the tunnel's report, they do not supervise its process.

Connection startup derives prerequisites from the **live capability projection**, not from the
mere existence of a connector. A root is required only when some enabled capability actually
crosses the filesystem boundary; screen/clipboard-only Desktop access must not accidentally waive
a Core root requirement or demand one it never uses. The Core endpoint starts first and its
handler closure re-reads current config for every call, so a permission save affects enforcement
without rebuilding the HTTP listener.

The optional Desktop publication is failure-contained. A missing/mistyped second OpenAI tunnel id
may put the Desktop card in `off/error`, but it does **not** tear down a healthy Core connector.
`applySettings()` reconnects Core only when the transport-defining tuple really changed; a
Desktop-only permission/tunnel change rebuilds/publishes that surface in place. This is why
renderer settings must call the connection owner rather than mutating status cards directly.

Disconnect and final shutdown deliberately differ. An ordinary disconnect/settings reconnect has
no outer force deadline because the app keeps running and must not drop an accepted response that
ChatGPT could retry. Final `shutdownConnection()` invalidates the generation synchronously and then
allows the MCP endpoint a bounded **30-second** drain inside the app-wide shutdown budget. Stale
tunnel callbacks after that generation change are ignored even if the child process emits them
while being stopped.

**Desktop automation (Windows/macOS).** `tools-desktop.ts` + `computer/*` own the shared model
contract, frame/ref lifetime, batching and helper protocol. Windows implements that protocol with
PowerShell, Win32 UI Automation and SendInput; macOS loads a thin Swift library through an N-API
addon on a Node Worker thread inside the Electron main process. That in-process boundary is
load-bearing: tccd authorises the responsible Electron app, while a raw spawned child can be
reduced to a different path-based subject even when the parent is allowed. Registration-time permission is not enough: each action
re-checks, and macOS Screen Recording/Accessibility consent remains an independent OS boundary.
The helper is prewarmed only when native Desktop capabilities are published; window observation is
background-first and never focuses. Recent immutable frames bind coordinates to screenshot and
window geometry; semantic refs bind cached elements to bounded native accessibility snapshots. Both also
retain the producing helper generation, stamped on the transport reply before asynchronous image
I/O. Frame/ref-based requests recheck that identity at native dispatch, including after local work
in a batch; helper replacement never transfers an old snapshot to the new instance.
Visible-pixel crops and window-capture fallbacks are always screen-bound even when their request or
coordinates named a window; otherwise an occluding app's pixels could be relabelled as the covered
window. Screen captures compare the exact active-display rectangles with ScreenCaptureKit's snapshot
and re-check them through and after capture. Physical input revalidates the target, and a semantic or
explicit focus step carries its proven window into later keyboard actions in the same batch instead
of degrading to global HID input. Batches report partial completion and route evidence.
Image coordinates clamp to the frame's inclusive integer interior, and final text plus base64 image
share one measured MCP result budget. The in-process Swift path sets a native AX messaging timeout and
one aggregate bounded traversal deadline because a Node Worker timeout cannot pre-empt a synchronous
accessibility call. Compact local postconditions avoid model-driven wait/observe loops. The browser on this desktop may be holding
this app's own ChatGPT chats and a keyboard chord cannot see which tab it lands on, so
`browser-chords.ts` names the tab/window/address-bar chords and `tools-desktop.ts` refuses them
whenever the keys would reach a browser process. Tests: `computer*.test.ts` and
the opt-in `macos-computer-live.test.ts` packaged-host probe.

**Secrets are one encrypted blob with serialized mutation, not three loose files.** `secrets.ts`
stores `openaiApiKey`, the extension `bridgeToken`, and `openRouterApiKey` in `secrets.bin` through
Electron's async `safeStorage`. The renderer gets only booleans/status; plaintext never crosses IPC,
config or logs. Cache miss is single-flight and every mutation is a queued read-modify-write,
because concurrent async decrypt + save can otherwise republish stale plaintext or erase another
key. The encrypted file is temp→rename and the cache updates only after durable publication.

On Linux, "Electron says encryption is available" is not enough: Chromium can fall back to its
legacy `v10` hard-coded-key provider. `secureStorageStatus()` encrypts a non-secret probe and checks
the ciphertext bytes; that insecure fallback is treated as **unavailable**, not as encrypted
credential storage. A decrypt of an unknown/malformed future blob may degrade reads to no secret,
but a mutation must not compose from an invented empty map and overwrite ciphertext it did not
understand. Unknown string fields are preserved for forward compatibility.

**Diagnostics report unknown as unknown.** `diagnostics.ts` tests the connector chain hop-by-hop:
secure storage/config → local MCP initialize/tools-list → tunnel local readiness/metrics/client
status → external-route evidence → whether ChatGPT has contacted the connector / actually called a
tool. A check can be `pass`, `fail`, `skipped` or `not-run`; do not turn missing evidence into a
green boolean. Developer Mode inference specifically compares "ChatGPT reached the connector" with
"a tool ever followed" — transport health and model tool permission are separate diagnoses.

`logger.ts` is deliberately not durable telemetry. It keeps only 500 redacted entries in RAM,
inherits current agent attribution from call AsyncLocalStorage, and exports the already-redacted
projection. If a fact is needed for restart recovery, it does not belong in this log; give it a
real durable owner instead. Since 2.0.3 the same redacted lines are also mirrored to
`userData/app.log` (`initLogFile()` in `index.ts`; 4 MB, one `.1` rotation, self-disabling on write
failure) so a failed overnight run can still be read the next morning — the 2026-09-02 run left no
log at all. Ordinary writes use ordered asynchronous batches (64 KiB batches, 256 KiB pending,
16 KiB per entry); overload leaves an explicit omission count. Final exit waits up to two seconds.
Fatal failure or a failed final flush writes a separate bounded `.crash` snapshot. Nothing reads
those files back as state authority; they are for humans.

MCP HTTP completion lines include bounded numeric timing for ingress, identity/admission, handler,
delivery preparation, recorder and local response completion. Unidentified recordings report their
asynchronous settle time separately. A handler's own identity wait remains inside its handler time.
These measurements do not prove remote ChatGPT receipt. `scripts/benchmark-mcp-latency.mjs` compares
explicit local/tunnel routes with the same read-only discovery request; it never invokes a tool.

**On-disk state to inspect.** Electron `userData` — `%APPDATA%\chat-on-steroids\` on Windows,
`~/Library/Application Support/chat-on-steroids/` on macOS, `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/chat-on-steroids/`
on Linux — contains `config.json` (non-secret validated settings), `sessions/` (durable history),
`state/` (small durable indexes, e.g. `request-correlations`, swarm), and the stable packaged
extension mirror used by Chrome. Credentials live through `secrets.ts`/OS safeStorage. Extension
state is separate: `chrome.storage.local` for preferences/pairing, `chrome.storage.session`
for the journal and live tab/document state. Two command-control facts intentionally join the
browser-restart lifetime in `storage.local`: `deferredRevivals` (marker only, never the prime's
text) and `commandAckOutbox` (irreversible ChatGPT send outcomes; also mirrored into session state
for the live-worker/migration path). When a restart bug appears, **first name which process
restarted** — app, service worker, content script, Fiber helper, document, tab, or browser.
Each has a different persistence boundary.

## 19. Working in this repository

### The tree is dirty and shared

Several agents and the user may be editing at once. Before touching anything:

```powershell
git status --short
git diff -- <files you plan to touch>
```

Assume unrelated changes belong to someone else. **Never** `reset`, `checkout`, `clean`,
broad-format, or overwrite unrelated work to simplify your patch. If the exact lines you
planned to edit changed underneath you, reread and integrate — do not replay an old patch.

### The fix loop

1. Reproduce the real bug, or add a regression that **fails under the old input/ordering**.
2. Fix the earliest root cause — not the last place the wrongness became visible.
3. Run the nearest test file.
4. Run adjacent boundary tests when a protocol crosses modules.
5. `npm run verify` before calling production code done.
6. `npm run build` / package checks when bundling, native modules, resources, extension
   shipping or installer behavior could differ.

A good fix here has three parts: the root-cause change, a targeted regression, and a comment
naming the non-obvious invariant when a future "simplification" could reopen it.

**Green unit tests do not prove** a browser race, a Windows reparse race, an Electron
ordering race, a live ChatGPT Fiber shape, a process race, or resource-scale behavior. Model
the missing adversarial ordering, and use a live repro when feasible. For races prefer
epochs, generation ids, serialized mutation queues, idempotency keys, exact identity or
ownership locks — **not sleeps**, unless time really is the protocol. The reusable pattern:

```text
start A → pause A before its durable/publish step → run B to completion
        → resume A → assert B was not overwritten, resurrected or misattributed
```

Every security or identity fix needs its **negative case**: in-root native path works /
escaping native path fails; exact correlation routes / conflicting correlation does not
guess; owner polls the terminal / another worker cannot; current epoch accepts the Fiber
answer / stale epoch discards it.

**Both sides of a protocol.** A compiling one-sided edit is still broken. The multi-hop
protocols are: app↔extension bridge, content↔Fiber `postMessage`, main↔preload↔renderer
IPC, MCP schema↔handler↔recorder summary, durable store↔restart restoration.

### Commands

```sh
npm ci                                   # clean/reproducible install from package-lock.json
npm run dev                              # electron-vite dev
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --run test/<target>.test.ts
npm run verify:privacy                   # public Git identity/session/path gate
npm run verify                           # the exact CI gate: rg fetch, privacy, typecheck, full Vitest
npm run build                            # electron-vite bundles
npm run dist                             # this host OS, x64 + arm64 artifacts → release/
npm run dist:mac / dist:linux            # explicit platform families on matching hosts
npm run dist:dir:<platform>:<arch>        # one unpacked package for smoke/debug
```

Use `npm install` instead of `npm ci` only when dependency metadata is intentionally being changed.
`npm run verify` is not shorthand for one `vitest run`: `verify:ci` first ensures bundled ripgrep,
runs the public-history privacy gate, typechecks, runs the ordinary Vitest set **excluding**
`mcp-shutdown`, then runs `mcp-shutdown` separately so its real socket/process-drain timing is not
distorted by the rest of the suite.

`vitest.config.ts` is part of the safety boundary, not generic test boilerplate. Vitest runs the
tracked `test/**/*.test.ts` set in Node with 30-second test/hook limits because many suites use real
filesystem, child processes and HTTP. It also forces `CLF_BRIDGE_PORTS=0`, so a test can never bind
or fall through to the production 8765–8769 bridge range and accidentally talk to the developer's
installed app. `CLF_EVIDENCE_MS=1500` is **test-only acceleration** for in-process evidence that is
microseconds-or-never; never copy that value into production browser attribution timing.

### Where a regression belongs

77 tracked `*.test.ts` suites in the current tree, named for the subsystem or boundary they cover.
Vitest uses real filesystem, real processes and real HTTP in many of them. **Do not maintain this
count by memory**: derive it from `git ls-files 'test/*.test.ts'` when updating this section.

### Delegating to workers

The prompt is part of the engineering work — a worker receives its task, not this
conversation. Each assignment states: project path, concrete objective, relevant subsystem
and likely files, evidence or reproduced symptoms it should inherit, constraints and
ownership boundaries, what it may edit, validation to run, and the expected handoff.

Start with the actual task. **Do not** open with canned text like "you have zero prior
context" — prefer `Fix the renderer state-clobber bug in C:\…; the confirmed symptom is …`.
Workers are already bound to their slot when launched, so nothing is asked of them about
identity. Put what every worker in the batch needs — project path, conventions file,
ownership boundaries, validation to run — in `spawn`'s `context` once; each `task` then
carries only that worker's own objective and files.

For audit-only roles make the write boundary explicit: source, tests, AppData and config
stay read-only, and each worker may create only its named report. The prime then reads the
source itself, reproduces release-blocking claims, records what it accepted or rejected, and
owns every production edit. **Parallel reports are independent hypotheses — not votes, not
proof.**

When a recurring symptom is not yet a clean issue, use the available local transcripts and
durable session metadata to follow **one** concrete request id, conversation id, worker slot
or event sequence end to end. Keep any security-sensitive reproduction material private.

## 20. Packaging and release — `electron-builder.yml`

App id `com.chatonsteroids.app`, product `Chat On Steroids`. Releases build six native
platform/architecture jobs: Windows x64/ARM64 NSIS, macOS x64/ARM64 DMG+ZIP, and Linux
x64/ARM64 AppImage+DEB. Windows stays per-user-capable, `asInvoker`, no forced elevation.

- Only `out/**` + `package.json` go into app files.
- Target-specific tunnel and ripgrep resources ship outside asar — they must execute as real files.
- `extension/` ships outside asar — Chrome's "Load unpacked" needs a real folder.
- In packaged runtime `extension-path.ts` mirrors that bundled extension to stable `userData/extension`;
  do not point Chrome directly at an AppImage's temporary mount.
- `node-pty`, Sharp/libvips and tree-sitter native payloads are staged for the exact target
  platform/arch; host-native build/prebuild leftovers must never override them.
- macOS packages compile and stage one thin Swift dylib plus an architecture-matched N-API addon;
  both remain outside asar and are loaded on a Node Worker thread in the Electron main process.
  The standalone CLI build is a development protocol probe only and must never become the packaged
  TCC subject again. Test through the installed app because TCC attribution cannot be proved by
  invoking the source-tree binary.
- Uninstall/package replacement deliberately preserves per-user app data.

Before cutting a version, synchronize `package.json`, `src/main/version.ts` and
`extension/manifest.json`, and run the full suite. After installing a local build, verify
the **packaged** app really contains the target extension/tunnel/ripgrep/native runtime and can
execute its PTY/parser/image stack — a successful installer/archive build does not prove it.

The build layers are distinct and a green earlier layer does not imply a later one:

```text
TypeScript source + plain MV3 extension
  → electron-vite: main / preload / renderer bundles in out/
  → packaging prepare: target-specific tunnel + rg + native node modules
  → electron-builder: platform artifact, extension/resources outside asar as required
  → packaged-runtime smoke: start the built app and exercise resources/native stacks in place
  → release assemble: collect all six target jobs + extension ZIP + SHA256SUMS.txt
  → publish: only from a reviewed version tag, without rebuilding from another ref/run
```

The extension has **no separate bundling step**: `manifest.json`, `background.js`,
`chatgpt-dom.js`, `content.js`, `fiber.js`, popup assets and CSS ship as source files. Any change to
extension JavaScript is therefore both runtime code and package input; tests that import/evaluate
those scripts do not prove electron-builder actually included the intended bytes.

### Packaging/release script ownership

The `scripts/` directory is build/release code, not an unstructured bag of helpers:

| Script | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `package.mjs` | one packaging invocation: regenerate icons → electron-vite build → for each target arch fetch tunnel + rg → stage native modules → run electron-builder with publishing disabled |
| `packaging-targets.mjs` | the only supported package OS/arch vocabulary (`win32|darwin|linux` × `x64|arm64`), aliases and target-specific builder/archive/native-path naming |
| `packaging-versions.mjs` | pinned tunnel-client/ripgrep version + target SHA-256 manifest; fetchers and smoke tests consume this rather than carrying their own versions |
| `fetch-tunnel-client.mjs` | download/checksum/extract the pinned OpenAI tunnel bundle for one explicit target; host-target runs also refresh the development mirror |
| `fetch-ripgrep.mjs` | same pattern for pinned rg; Linux deliberately uses portable musl upstream builds |
| `prepare-packaging-native.mjs` | materialize target Sharp packages from **package-lock URL+integrity**, then stage verified target node-pty/tree-sitter/Sharp trees without allowing host leftovers to win |
| `smoke-packaged-runtime.mjs` | prove an unpacked artifact contains the exact extension, licenses, tunnel, rg and target native modules and that the packaged executable/runtime can actually load/use them |
| `smoke-macos-bundle.mjs` + `macos-audit-utils.mjs` | native macOS bundle audit: Info.plist contract, thin Mach-O arch, deployment floors, executable bits and current unsigned/no-trust-bearing-signature policy; helper safely handles parenthesized Electron helper names with classic `otool` |
| `smoke-macos-gui.mjs` | launch the packaged macOS GUI, require app/window/renderer-ready evidence plus a minimum survival window, then terminate it cleanly; package existence alone is not a GUI startup proof |
| `make-icon.mjs` | reproducibly derive app/runtime/extension icon sizes from the one controlled artwork PNG without introducing an image-build dependency |
| `verify-public-history.mjs` | release-line privacy/provenance gate over reachable HEAD history/tags plus staged/current identity; PR synthetic merge identity is excluded because it can never enter public history, and commits already reachable from `origin/main` are exempt because they have already entered it — a forge-written merge commit no local hook ever saw must not strand every later push, and unpublishing one is a deliberate public rewrite rather than a hook's call |
| `check-release-absent.mjs` | fail closed unless GitHub positively says the tag has no existing release; unexpected API failures never mean “safe to overwrite” |
| `install-git-hooks.mjs` | opt the checkout into versioned `.githooks/` through `core.hooksPath` |
| `kill-stray-vitest.mjs` | explicit recovery command for test worker trees orphaned by an interrupted run; matches Vitest command lines rather than killing arbitrary Node processes |

Generated/staged build resources are **outputs of these mechanisms**, not second source trees to
hand-edit. Change the pin/source/script and regenerate; otherwise the next verified package run is
entitled to replace the manual edit.

Native payload selection is target-owned, never host-leftover-owned. Packaging deliberately
excludes host `node-pty`/Sharp/tree-sitter build/prebuild directories from the generic file set and
adds the prepared target tree back for exactly the requested OS/arch. Cross-arch packages that
accidentally prefer a host `build/Release` directory can build successfully and then fail only on
the user's machine; that is why package smoke is a release gate, not optional polish.

`release.yml` is reusable and its matrix builds/smokes every target on a native runner, then one
`assemble` job downloads all package artifacts, creates the standalone extension ZIP and
`SHA256SUMS.txt`, and uploads one release candidate. Publishing runs through
`.github/workflows/publish.yml`, dispatched at the tag itself
(`gh workflow run publish.yml --ref vX.Y.Z`). It calls `release.yml` as a reusable workflow,
so the installers a release carries are built from the tag being published inside the run
that publishes them, and never travel between runs. A tag alone no longer builds anything.
`publish.yml` refuses a non-tag ref, refuses a tag with no reviewed
`docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`, re-checks the packaging runner's SHA-256 sums before
attaching the files, runs the public-history privacy gate again, and refuses to overwrite an
existing release. Maintainers and agents install the versioned Git hooks with
`npm run hooks:install`; those hooks reject personal maintainer identities and Claude session
provenance before it can be committed or pushed. `release.yml` on
`workflow_dispatch` still produces an unpublished candidate from any ref.

CI and release answer different questions. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs verification on the
supported OS families so TypeScript/tests do not silently become Windows-only; `release.yml` is the
native packaging matrix that proves each concrete artifact. `publish.yml` then re-checks version
agreement, release-note presence, privacy/history and hashes at the **tag being published**. Never
replace that chain with "CI passed on main, so upload local installers" — it breaks provenance
between reviewed source and shipped bytes.

## 21. Security-sensitive areas

Some subsystems sit directly on trust boundaries and need extra review: browser/session identity,
MCP request lifecycle, approved-path enforcement, process execution, desktop control, secrets,
and resource limits. Keep public documentation focused on contracts and invariants rather than
publishing exploit recipes or detailed reproductions for unresolved weaknesses.

Before changing one of these areas, reproduce the behavior against the current tree, preserve
fail-closed behavior, add a deterministic regression where practical, and verify neighboring
negative/security cases. Suspected security issues and reproduction details belong through the
private process in `SECURITY.md`, not in public issues, comments, or fixtures.

**Do not scatter fixes across symptoms before proving the shared root.**

## 22. Definition of done

- The reproduced failure is gone **for the root reason** — not hidden in the UI, not retried
  until lucky.
- The neighboring negative / security case still holds.
- A targeted regression captures the old failure ordering or input.
- Every producer and consumer of any changed protocol agrees.
- Model-visible schema and user-visible surface still match the implementation.
- Unrelated dirty work is untouched.
- Targeted tests pass and `npm run verify` passes.
- Build/packaging checked when the changed layer can differ after bundling.
- Comments and this file updated only where behavior genuinely changed.

> **The rule.** Name the identity crossing the failing boundary, follow one concrete item
> end to end, and fix the earliest place where reality diverges from that identity or
> invariant.

Intentional `after-turn` inputs for an existing ordinary chat share the durable staged-task FIFO and composer queue dock. Multiple waits are admitted, but each browser claim spends one distinct verified completed `turn_end`; repeated observations or restart cannot drain the next item. An after-turn wait does not block later Inject now messages from an eligible tool response. Initial and immediate browser sends retain single-send admission. Edits and reordering apply only before claim; the durable edit receipt ends the renderer's editing state without waiting for another queue read.
Immediate inputs are batched into one eligible MCP response in queue order within the existing payload bounds; after-turn and finish stages retain their separate one-boundary-at-a-time policy. Model catalog election requires a visible composer, so an editor hidden behind Settings cannot claim the refresh. Captured provider citation ranges use Unicode code points; the renderer maps them to UTF-16 and emits exact uploaded-file chip names as plain text, omitting unresolved file citations.
Tool input delivery carries ordered messages plus one batch reminder. The dispatcher renders one
user-instruction heading, each authored message followed by its images, and the reminder once at
the end. Input UUIDs stay in durable claims/history and never decorate model-visible messages;
receipts still use exact session/conversation custody and the later invocation start. Text bounds
include the one heading, separators and reminder before any input is claimed.

Finish checkpoints inherit the current chat model. `shared/input.ts::browserInputModel`
projects null picker settings for finish entries, including legacy rows whose authored fields
still contain the initial model. Browser handout, finish appendix and delivery-history model
evidence use that same projection. Newly materialized plan stages store no model override;
explicit direct/after-turn sends retain their requested model. An inherited checkpoint receipt
must never republish the stale enqueue-time picker as an observed model switch.

Plugins presents unconfigured connection setup as a red-outlined card; saved plugin tunnel
identity or a live endpoint projects the compact setup row, including offline restarts with
saved configuration. A persistent reminder asks users to refresh
the ChatGPT Plugins connector after installation or enabled-tool changes. Local status checks
do not refresh ChatGPT's tool catalog. The notice generator rejects missing production license
material and mismatched catalog notice hashes, and includes native LGPL/GPL/MPL supplements.
CI runs `verify:notices` against each host's installed production dependencies and checks
their versions against the lockfile. Packaging regenerates the host-specific inventory.
Reviewed plugin license labels require an exact package kind, name and version; custom updates
cannot inherit a previous catalog review. Native binary source/replacement obligations remain
separate from notice validation; see `docs/plugin-notice-audit.md`.
Complete notice text is not proof of corresponding-source compliance for binary distribution;
verify exact native dependency source/build provenance and actual release artifacts separately.
