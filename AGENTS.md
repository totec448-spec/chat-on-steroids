# Chat On Steroids — the agent map

Quality>> quantity. User wants less new code and delete more old code. Don't bloat the codebase, make it shorter and better and more maintainable Everytime you work on it. It should shrink not ballon.

**User hates a growing codebase. Quality >> quantity.** New findings should improve the underlying
decision and replace/delete obsolete logic, not stack another fallback, watcher, state machine, or
special case on top. Prefer less code, fewer branches, one deterministic source of truth, and reuse
of existing mechanisms. Every change should make the system smaller, simpler, and easier to reason
about where practical. Do not spam fixes into the codebase; fix the decision from the ground up.

**No build-up: rewrite the affected subsystem with the new feature/invariant in mind.** Do not keep
the old architecture and bolt a new path beside it merely because that is the smallest diff. When a
new implementation supersedes an old assumption, recode that specific area around the new source of
truth, delete the obsolete branches/state/fallbacks it replaces, and converge callers/tests on that
one design. This is not permission for broad rewrites: change only the affected subsystem, but leave
it architecturally cleaner and preferably smaller than before.

**Rule: no build up; rewrite with the new feature in mind.**

**This tree is usually dirty and shared with the user and other agents — never `reset`,
`checkout`, `clean`, reformat, or overwrite work you did not do.**

The single orientation document for this repository. Read it before changing anything.

**How to use it.** §1–§3 is the mental model; read those once, in order. §4 is "where is the
thing". §5–§17 is one section per subsystem, each with the same shape — what it owns, its
files, its flow, **what must hold**, how it fails, which tests cover it. §18 is the fastest
entry point when you have a symptom and no theory. §19–§22 is how to work here.

**One file, complete.** This replaces the old `AGENTS.md` + `agent.md` split, which
duplicated roughly 60% of its content and had already drifted between copies. It is sized
for completeness rather than for any tool's default project-document budget; if your
harness truncates long project docs, raise its limit rather than cutting this down.

## 1. The app in sixty seconds

A **Windows/macOS/Linux Electron app** that hands ChatGPT a deliberately small set of local
computer capabilities over MCP. It is a bridge and a permission layer — not a chat client,
not a model host. It also ships a Chrome extension that watches ChatGPT itself, so the app can
record conversations, prove which conversation issued which tool call, replace generic tool
rows with what actually happened, compact a long chat into a fresh one, and run worker chats.
Core is portable; the Desktop/computer-use surface is deliberately Windows-only and must be
absent from live macOS/Linux capability/discovery state.

Four runtime planes, only two of which are servers:

**The MCP server and the browser bridge are two different servers with two different
threat models.** MCP is the model's capability endpoint. The bridge exists only for the
Chrome extension and deliberately has no route that reads a file, runs a command, or
changes a permission. Never merge their lifecycles or their auth.

The extension never executes a tool. It observes ChatGPT and reports evidence. **The app is
the only authority on what a local tool actually did.** The renderer has no Node, no
filesystem, no command, no network authority; it crosses preload through named IPC.

## 2. Where the bugs actually are

Almost nothing hard here is a local algorithm bug. The hard ones live on six boundaries:

| Boundary | The two things people confuse |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery vs. enforcement | a schema ChatGPT cached vs. a permission that is live *now* |
| Path spelling | `/project/src/a.ts` vs. a native `C:\work\...` or `/home/...` path — same decision required |
| Request vs. conversation | HTTP `x-request-id` vs. the ChatGPT conversation that owns it |
| Process lifetime | content script (document) vs. service worker (suspends) vs. app (restarts) |
| Durable vs. frontend identity | local session id vs. the ChatGPT conversation attached to it |
| Async vs. selection | a load started for A vs. the B the user has since selected |

If a bug looks like four subsystems failing at once, it is one of these, once. Find the
**earliest wrong identity or state transition** — not the last UI that displayed it.

### Name the identity, then find where it is lost

Every boundary above is a place where one specific identity is supposed to survive. Before
reading any code, say which one this bug is about. If you cannot state it, you have not
found the real boundary yet.

| Plane | The identity that must survive |
| --- | --- |
| filesystem | approved root + canonical real path |
| MCP call | normalized request id |
| tool ownership | request id -> conversation id |
| browser observation | conversation id + navigation epoch + message/turn identity |
| agent | conversation id -> prime or worker slot |
| workspace | conversation/agent key -> cwd |
| terminal | proven owner -> exec session id |
| session | local session id + conversation lineage |
| compaction | continuation token + from/to conversation |
| renderer load | selected session id + load generation |
| connection | tunnel/endpoint generation |
| desktop coordinates | screenshot frame id |

Then classify which plane produced the **first** wrong fact — MCP transport/discovery,
permission/sandbox/tool runtime, browser observation/identity, bridge/session/agent
orchestration, renderer presentation, or tunnel/packaging. Do not start in the file where
the symptom is displayed.

Three policies apply everywhere and are not repeated per section:

- **Fail closed** when a guess could cause cross-root access, cross-chat attribution,
  cross-agent terminal control, wrong workspace mutation, wrong compaction target, unsafe
  rendered HTML, or invalid image content reaching the model. For presentation-only
  degradation, keep the UI usable and label the uncertainty instead.
- **Scope every async result to the epoch that requested it** — navigation epoch, load
  generation, connection generation, endpoint lifetime. Id equality alone is not enough:
  an A → B → A navigation defeats it.
- **Bound every representation of large output** — bytes, tokens, decoded pixels, base64,
  structured fields. Not just the visible text, and not just the compressed input.

## 3. What is authoritative

Sources disagree here because the architecture moved fast. Precedence:

1. current implementation **plus a reproducible test or live repro**;
2. current declarations: `mcp/surfaces.ts`, `mcp/tools-core.ts`, `mcp/tools-desktop.ts`,
   `shared/types.ts`, `package.json`, `main/version.ts`, `extension/manifest.json`;
3. `README.md`;
4. public design references such as `docs/tool-surface.md`. Internal working notes and
   security reproductions are maintainer-only; a public clone should treat §5–§18 of this
   file as the architecture and design record.

**Code comments in this project are unusually load-bearing.** Many name the exact live
failure that motivated a guard. Read the comment before deleting the guard or "simplifying"
the state machine. Code and current tests still win when a comment has drifted.

### Baseline

Release numbers are authoritative in `package.json`, `src/main/version.ts` and
`extension/manifest.json`; the bridge protocol is `version.ts::BRIDGE_PROTOCOL`. Tests assert
the app/extension versions stay in sync, so this architecture guide deliberately does not
copy a release number that can drift. Core is cross-platform; main process is TypeScript;
extension is plain MV3 JavaScript with no build step; Vitest; `node-pty` is the main native
terminal dependency. Desktop automation remains explicitly Windows-only.

Fresh-install defaults from `config.ts` — **all Core tool permissions on**, **read-only off**,
**recording on**, session advisory/limit **400k/533k** estimated tokens, **auto-compaction on
at 400k and edge-triggered**, **multi-agent on** with `maxWorkers` 2 (hard max 8). The limit is
derived, never typed: the Chat panel offers one threshold and writes `limit = threshold × 4/3`,
so the defaults have to satisfy that relation or the first save in that panel moves the red
line. Existing
configs keep explicit user choices; conservative migration defaults do not widen omitted legacy
permissions merely because the fresh-install defaults are broader. Windows also enables the
Desktop capability group; macOS/Linux mask that group off at runtime while preserving stored
choices so a config moved back to Windows does not lose them.

### Stale-doc traps

Do not "restore" these from an older document:

- `view_image` is its own Core tool, not a mode of `read`.
- Core declares **8** tool names but at most **7** are live: `find` and the exec pair are
  mutually exclusive. Desktop adds at most 2. Live ceiling is 9, and reporting must derive
  from the surface projection, never a hardcoded count.
- `session` has exactly two actions, `search` and `read`. Search discovers recordings; read
  requires an explicit local session id and returns lossless cursor pages. Compact & Resume is
  app/browser orchestration — there is no model-visible `save_handoff`.
- Extension pairing is silent loopback `/pair` bearer provisioning. The six-digit flow is gone.
- Canonical messages live in `messages/*.json`, one replaceable shard per logical id; legacy
  `messages.json` is read during lazy migration. They are not appended forever to `events.jsonl`.
- `computer` carries **13** action variants, not 11.

`exec.ts` remains as the shared low-level process/environment primitive used by unified exec,
the Windows desktop helper and tunnels. The retired connector-native managed-process and patch
stacks were removed after production moved to `codex/unified-exec.ts` and `codex/apply-patch/*`;
do not recreate parallel runtimes beside those live owners.

---

## 5. Startup and shutdown — `index.ts`

```text
single-instance lock → userData paths (config/secrets/sessions/state)
  → load validated config + durable state
  → restore request correlations, repair deterministic attribution
  → restore swarm if multi-agent enabled
  → hardened BrowserWindow → register fixed IPC handlers
  → start bridge if recording OR multi-agent → prune old sessions
  → auto-connect MCP/tunnel if configured
```

**Must hold.** The window keeps context isolation on, Node integration off, renderer
sandbox on, navigation and window creation constrained, permission requests denied unless
explicitly supported. Never weaken that to solve a renderer convenience problem. Every new
long-lived process, timer, listener, queue or durable writer names its shutdown owner —
teardown covers tunnels, both listeners, process sessions, then flushes session and durable state.

`will-quit` calls `preventDefault()` and owns the decision to quit from then on, and it
destroys the tray before teardown starts. So teardown is not merely ordered, it is **bounded**:
`shutdown.ts` gives each phase its own budget and always ends the process. A task that never
settles would otherwise strand an invisible main process holding the single-instance lock, and
every later launch of the app would silently do nothing. Per-task bounds are not a substitute
for that — "each piece is bounded" is a different claim from "the sequence ends".

Ending it is `app.exit(0)`, never `app.quit()`, and that is not interchangeable. Electron drops
a quit raised from the promise continuation that finishes teardown: on Windows the call returns
without even emitting `before-quit`, while the same call one macrotask later quits normally.
`shutdown.ts` therefore owns the exit itself rather than trusting its caller to remember.

## 6. MCP surfaces and discovery — `surfaces.ts`, `tools.ts`, `server.ts`

ChatGPT discovers **one server's entire tool list as a unit**: a no-query
`list_resources` returns every schema that server advertises. Splitting into separate
servers is therefore the only mechanism that actually bounds the worst case. Two surfaces
earn it today.

**Core** (`chat-on-steroids-core`, required):

| Tool | Live when | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | `read` \| `browse` \| `metadata` | `tools-core.ts` → `codex/read-backend.ts` |
| `view_image` | `read` | `tools-core.ts` → `codex/view-image.ts` |
| `find` | `search` **and not** `command` | `tools-core.ts` → `search.ts` |
| `apply_patch` | any of `create`/`edit`/`move`/`deleteFile` | `codex/apply-patch/*` |
| `exec_command`, `write_stdin` | `command` | `codex/unified-exec.ts` |
| `session` | recording enabled | session subsystem |
| `agents` | multi-agent enabled | `agents.ts` |

**Desktop** (`chat-on-steroids-desktop`, optional, **Windows-only**): `observe` needs `screen`;
`computer` registers on `control` **or** either clipboard permission, then re-checks each
of its 13 actions at runtime. The surface is offered at all only when one of those four
permissions exists on Windows — an empty or impossible connector is worse than no connector.

**Exposure is monotonic per endpoint lifetime.** ChatGPT caches schemas, and yanking one
from under a cached snapshot surfaces as a transport-level UNKNOWN failure. So
`server.ts` remembers what this endpoint has ever exposed. A permission revoked after
exposure leaves the schema registered and its handler returns `TOOL_DISABLED`. The
`find`-vs-exec choice is frozen the same way, at first discovery.

**Must hold.** Two separate concepts, never collapsed: *exposed* (a schema may exist
because it was visible earlier) and *live* (the operation is allowed now).
**Schema visibility is never the security boundary** — `config.ts::effectiveCapabilities()`
and the live guards are. A server registers only tools its surface declares and answers
anything else with a protocol-level unknown-tool error; there is no merged list and no
hidden acceptance. A deliberate reconnect is the clean boundary for changing the shape.

**Tests.** `mcp.test.ts`, `config.test.ts`, `mcp-shutdown.test.ts`.

## 7. One MCP call, end to end

```text
tunnel request
 → server.ts    loopback Host/Origin, secret tokenized path, bounded body,
                x-request-id read + normalized (split before '/')
 → tools.ts     build only the requested surface
 → kernel.ts    AsyncLocalStorage call context
                resolve exact caller from correlation evidence
                resolve agent identity if a swarm is active
                wait for identity when the operation genuinely needs it
                enforce the live capability / read-only guard
 → tool handler sandbox any model path, execute, attach structured evidence
                (changes, counts, exit code, session id, assets)
 → recorder.ts  exact args/result/outcome; attach ONLY on proven ownership
 → kernel       agent inbox offer/ack bookkeeping
 → response
```

`server.ts` manually reads and bounds chunked / no-`Content-Length` POST bodies before
handing parsed JSON to the MCP adapter. **Do not regress that to a `Content-Length`-only
guard.** `inbound.ts` captures the raw header because the MCP library's higher-level
context has not reliably exposed it.

`call-context.ts` keeps **two** in-flight counters: handlers currently executing, and MCP
requests still in dispatch (including the identity wait and the durable recording that
happens after the handler returns). Orphan and stale-agent cleanup depends on the wider
one — a tool can have finished mutating the machine while its request is still being
attributed.

## 8. Filesystem containment — `sandbox.ts`

The authority for every model-supplied path. Approved folders get virtual roots such as
`/project`; native absolute paths are also accepted when they resolve inside an approved root.

**Must hold.**

- Every model filesystem path converges on `Sandbox.resolve()` or an already-validated
  wrapper. "It is only a read" is not an exemption — reads are confidentiality-sensitive.
- **Virtual and native spellings receive identical authorization.** Test both the virtual
  spelling and the host spelling (`C:\approved\project\src\a.ts` on Windows,
  `/home/me/project/src/a.ts` or `/Users/me/project/src/a.ts` on POSIX). Never "improve" native
  normalization by letting it collapse traversal the virtual spelling rejects.
- Containment covers root selection, host-invalid/path-trick rejection, canonical checks on
  existing targets, deepest-existing-ancestor validation for missing targets, reserved virtual
  root names, and symlink/reparse/junction handling as applicable to that OS.
- Authorization must remain valid at the point of filesystem use; avoid designs that rely
  only on an earlier pathname check when the underlying target can change.
- Native filesystem error text must not leak hidden physical root paths back to the model.

**Not contained: shell commands.** `exec_command` is arbitrary code execution as the
logged-in user. Its *starting cwd* is restricted to an approved folder; the command is not.
That is why `command` is the strongest permission and why read-only mode disables it
outright. Never claim approved roots contain arbitrary commands — they contain the app's
filesystem tools. Read-only derives from the complete write-capability list, so a new write
capability must become read-only-blocked automatically.

**Tests.** `sandbox.test.ts`, plus retained bughunt repros.

## 9. Workspaces — `workspace.ts`

Two ideas that are easy to confuse: **approved roots** are the security boundary the user
configured; a **workspace** is convenience state saying which project *this exact chat or
agent* is working in.

Keyed by exact chat/agent identity, learned from proven absolute paths and project markers,
inherited by spawned workers, moved by Compact & Resume.

**Must hold.** A relative path or omitted `workdir` with no trustworthy workspace **fails**
rather than mutating a guessed project. When caller identity is unresolved during a swarm,
never silently fall back to the first approved root — that turns an attribution failure
into a wrong-target mutation. Moving a workspace is state continuity, never a new
permission; the target still has to be legal.

**Tests.** `workspace.test.ts`, `swarm.test.ts`.

## 10. The Codex-derived tools — `src/main/codex/*`

Selected public Codex behavior ported into TypeScript. **It does not launch a Codex model
or require a Codex installation.**

**`exec_command` / `write_stdin`.** `unified-exec.ts` ports session ids, output draining,
head/tail buffering, yield deadlines, output token policy, interactive stdin, and sessions
that outlive the call that created them. Windows adaptations (quoting, interrupt) live
beside the port and stay explicit and tested against model-facing behavior. There is a
known Ctrl+C vs. natural-exit race worth keeping a regression for. The local MCP adaptation
also accepts `cmds` to run related commands sequentially in one labeled shell session, and an
empty `write_stdin` poll returns on first output instead of holding Codex's full collection
window. Start at `tools-core.ts`
→ `unified-exec.ts` → `shell.ts` → `ownership.ts` → `exec-output.ts`.

**`apply_patch`.** Model syntax is Codex V4A. MCP cannot expose a true freeform tool, so
the raw patch rides inside the `patch` string while the grammar lives in the description.
Engine under `apply-patch/`; the wrapper adds capability checks (per hunk kind — add needs
`create`, delete needs `deleteFile`, content change needs `edit`, rename needs `move`),
sandbox resolution, workspace behavior, recorder evidence. **Shell interception** also
exists so a model emitting `apply_patch` as a shell command still reaches the port — if the
failure involves `cd`, quoting, `&&` or other control flow, the bug is above the parser.

**`read`.** Deliberately four layers: `tools-core.ts` owns the model contract and
multi-path behavior; `read-backend.ts` owns decoding/listing semantics; `filesystem.ts` is
primitives only; `sandbox.ts` is policy. **Do not push authorization down into
`filesystem.ts` and assume the public tool became safe.**

**`view_image`.** 8 MiB transport ceiling. PNG gets a real decode check; JPEG/GIF/WebP
validation has documented limits and does not yet match upstream's full-decoder guarantee.
Synchronous validation of an adversarial compressed payload is a main-process resource
risk. An invalid `image` content block can break an entire model turn — **prefer rejection
over optimistic decoding.**

**Tests.** `codex-runtime-parity`, `codex-apply-patch-parity`,
`codex-apply-patch-invocation-parity`, `codex-view-image-parity`, `mcp`.

## 11. Identity — the spine of the whole project

An MCP payload contains **no trustworthy ChatGPT conversation id**. There is exactly one
accepted proof chain:

HTTP x-request-id                       (inbound.ts, normalized before '/')
  ≡ page message.metadata.request_id
  → fiber.js      emits allowlisted request evidence from the MAIN world
  → content.js    reports requestId + conversationId
  → background.js journals it durably
  → bridge.ts     accepts it for that conversation
  → correlation.ts  proves requestId → conversationId
  → consumed by: kernel · recorder · agents · workspace · terminal ownership
```

**Never substitute** active tab, timing, tool name, most-recent chat, only-generating chat,
worker payload, or arrival order. If proof is missing the safe state is **Unattributed**,
no workspace, or refusal for identity-sensitive work. Guessing is worse than losing
attribution: it routes commands, files, messages and history into the *wrong* chat.

This one chain explains symptoms that look unrelated — worker `WORKER_IDENTITY_LOST`, calls
piling into Unattributed, false worker stalls, wrong or absent project cwd, terminal
polling crossing chats, agent messages stopping, Overwrite having no local activity to
render. When several appear together, **debug the chain, not the symptoms**, in this order:

```text
server.ts/inbound.ts  did x-request-id arrive and normalize?
fiber.js              did the page model expose a matching metadata.request_id?
content.js            did refreshFiber receive it and emit tool_evidence?
background.js         was it journalled and delivered?
bridge.ts             was it accepted for the intended conversation?
correlation.ts        was requestId→conversationId stored, and restored after restart?
kernel.ts/recorder.ts did the call wait for, find and use the exact proof?
```

Agent routing is *downstream* of this. Do not start there.

**Tests.** `correlation.test.ts`, `mcp-inbound.test.ts`, `fiber.test.ts`,
`content-script.test.ts`, `swarm.test.ts`.

## 12. Session recording — `recorder.ts`, `store.ts`

Two independent producers, one durable timeline, neither replaceable by the other:

1. **MCP/app truth** — exact tool, arguments, result, outcome, file changes, duration, assets.
2. **Browser observation** — authored messages, turn lifecycle, native progress, visible
   errors, conversation identity, page request evidence.

The app knows *what the tool did*. The browser knows *which conversation and turn showed it*.

```text
userData/sessions/<id>/
  events.jsonl        append-oriented tool/turn/error/activity events
  messages/*.json     canonical user/assistant messages, one shard per logical id
  messages.json       legacy canonical map, read during lazy migration
  meta.json           atomically rewritten projection
  assets/<id>         screenshots and large/binary material
  handoffs/<id>.json  saved compaction briefs
```

**Must hold.** Streaming website messages are mutable snapshots of one logical message, so
Canonical message shards **replace by stable identity** — never turn that back into blind appends.
Structured activity stays append-oriented. Large values bound inline and spill to assets;
never fix a display-size problem by discarding the durable source. Durable state is the
authority across restart, and `meta.json` must never claim events that `events.jsonl` does
not contain. Unattributed is a **first-class state**, not a bug to paper over.

Distinct from `logger.ts`, which is small, redacted, RAM-only and operational.

**Tests.** `session.test.ts`, `chronology.test.ts`, `resume.test.ts`.

## 13. The Chrome extension — `extension/*`

Three execution contexts with **three different lifetimes**:

| File | World / lifetime | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chatgpt-dom.js` | isolated, document | every selector and DOM-shape assumption |
| `content.js` | isolated, document | observation, turn lifecycle, Overwrite, compact UI |
| `fiber.js` | **MAIN**, document | React/Fiber evidence the DOM does not reveal |
| `background.js` | MV3 worker, **suspends freely** | bridge token, journal, tab↔conversation registry |

Plus `chrome.storage.session` — survives worker sleep, dies with the browser session — and
tab↔conversation binding, which follows tab lifetime and explicit navigation.

**`chatgpt-dom.js`** groups logical turns, extracts authored text, finds buttons/errors/tool
rows, and strips CLF-owned surfaces before reading so rendered replacements do not feed back
into recording. When ChatGPT changes markup, fix it here. **Never scatter emergency
selectors into `content.js`.**

**`content.js`** owns per-document memory: conversation epoch, seen-message identities, live
turn state, Fiber cache, rendered replacement state, pre-service-worker queue.

**`fiber.js` is intentionally least trusted.** It emits a strict **allowlist** (not copied
props minus a denylist), never tool argument values, validates the exact CLF connector
names, and fails closed on unfamiliar React shapes. Its `postMessage` output is
page-controlled evidence useful for joining page to local truth — **never a credential**.
Its protocol version and the content-side expectations move together.

**Must hold.** ChatGPT is an SPA: every async result proves it still belongs to its
navigation epoch before mutating state. `pagehide` is **not** proof a conversation ended —
reload and bfcache fire it too; real closure is decided at the service-worker layer from tab
removal and navigation away. **Reload is not conversation close.** Content-script acceptance
means *handed to the journal*, not *stored by the app*, and the journal must never silently
lose something it already acknowledged as durable. Recovery must validate **every** context
whose health it needs — proving the isolated recorder is alive says nothing about a dead
MAIN-world Fiber helper. Recorder takeover is total ownership transfer: the predecessor must
disconnect MutationObservers and DOM/window handlers **and** unregister extension-level
`chrome.runtime.onMessage` / `chrome.storage.onChanged` listeners. An `alive=false` predecessor
must never answer a health check, compete for a worker-revival command, or repaint Overwrite
after the successor owns the document.

**Tests.** `content-script.test.ts`, `fiber.test.ts`, `extension.test.ts`.

## 14. The browser bridge — `bridge.ts`

A second loopback HTTP service on the first free port of **8765–8769**. The extension finds
it with `/hello`, silently provisions a bearer token with `/pair`, then uses authenticated
routes: `/status`, `/events`, `/closed`, `/activity`, `/compact`,
`/goal/draft`, `/goal/ack`, `/goal/objective`, `/goal/open`, `/settings` (GET and POST),
`/commands/redeem`, `/commands/ack`. `/settings` is the only pair the page may write, and
its GET exists for the one composer with no conversation to read `/activity` for: a New Chat.

**Must hold.** The token never enters the ChatGPT page — the service worker holds it in
extension-owned state and the app keeps its counterpart out of config and log surfaces. The
bridge exposes **no** filesystem, command, or config-mutation route. Protocol mismatch
against `BRIDGE_PROTOCOL` warns once rather than spamming. Concurrent startup must not race
on listener ownership.

Because this is where browser-observed lifecycle meets recorder, agents, continuation and
workspace state, a `bridge.ts` bug presents as a session, extension, or agent bug depending
on which end you inspect.

**Tests.** `bridge.test.ts`, `extension.test.ts`.

## 15. Compact & Resume — `session/continuation.ts`

**The local session id is the durable identity.** ChatGPT conversations A and B are
frontends attached to that one session in sequence.

```text
chat A owns session S
  → A writes its own final handoff brief   → captured and stored verbatim
  → open continuation token for S
  → open one marked fresh chat; exactly one claimant B redeems it
  → preflight   freeze prime/swarm transfers that must move atomically
  → DURABLE COMMIT   rebind S from A to B on disk        ← the one fallible phase
  → publish     recorder mapping, workspace binding, swarm prime binding
  → B continues session S
```

**Must hold.** If preflight or the durable write fails, **A keeps the session**. Once the
durable write succeeds, publication is total in-memory map movement. Never implement
compaction by creating a second session or copying history — the whole feature is continuity
of one durable id. Automatic compaction is a live level plus page-turn decision: an idle old
chat never fires merely because it sits above the threshold, a transient pre-send barrier
failure may retry on a later turn, and the continuation transaction is the sole durable
authority once the handoff crosses the semantic send boundary.

**Tests.** `continuation.test.ts`, `resume.test.ts`.

## 16. Multi-agent — `agents.ts`

Experimental, enabled on fresh installs while existing configs preserve their stored choice,
**one global active execution run at a time**, star topology:
`worker ← prime → worker`. Workers never message each other.

**Identity.** The prime is the conversation that successfully called `agents action=spawn`
with proven caller identity. Worker slots are opened by the app through browser bootstrap;
once the page has a real conversation id the extension reports it and the broker binds that
exact conversation before normal worker work proceeds. **Conversation identity is the
routing credential** — established from the same evidence as recorder attribution — so no
secret token rides in model arguments and **sender identity never comes from a model
argument**. There is no credential and no recovery action: a worker whose binding was lost
is rebound by the extension reporting its chat, never by something a model can present.

**Messaging is at-least-once until acknowledged**: queued durably → offered on a tool result
→ acknowledged by the next authenticated tool call. Offering on a result is **not** proof
the model received it. Never delete a message merely because it was offered.

**Workers sleep; they do not end.** `finish` reports a result and puts that worker to
*sleep*: it keeps its conversation, keeps its history, and stays revivable. Sleeping frees
its worker slot, so `maxWorkers` counts working workers only — a prime can create a new worker
while an older one sleeps and still wake that older worker afterwards. The same sleep happens without the tool call, from
durable evidence that the worker stopped: a settled final assistant turn, or quiescence
proven by `activeTurnId`/live-generating state rather than by a page heartbeat.

**Ownership outlives the active run.** When no worker occupies a slot, the active incarnation is
parked immediately and the one global execution claim is released. Its complete agent map becomes
a durable history keyed by the prime conversation: sleeping workers, terminal/non-revivable rows,
their exact ChatGPT conversation bindings, queued prime reports and monotonically allocated
`worker-N` history all remain. Another prime may now start its own active incarnation, including
its own same-named `worker-1`, without seeing or mutating the first prime's history. Caller-scoped
`status` always returns the history owned by that prime, even while somebody else owns the active
execution slot. A dormant prime may spawn a fresh worker without reviving a sleeper; waking an old
worker reactivates that owner's history only when the global execution slot is free. Explicit
swarm clear is different from parking: it retires the worker conversation fences and discards the
retained histories. Turning Multi-agent **off is not Clear**: it stops/withdraws live execution,
parks the owner history, and keeps that history durable through disabled app restarts so re-enable
can still show and revive the exact old worker conversations.

**Waking is messaging.** `agents action=message` to a sleeping worker reserves a free slot
inside the same durable barrier that queues the message, and only after that commit does the
browser get asked for anything. The revival is an ordinary durable bridge command whose spec
names the worker's own `conversationId`: the app opens `/c/<id>?clf=<command>`, the service
worker hands the job to that chat's existing tab if it is open (closing the duplicate it was
about to be typed in, then focusing the real one), and the content script types the prime's
words as a genuine user message. No free slot means the send is refused outright — nothing is
queued and nothing is typed. A revival that fails puts the worker back to `sleeping`, returns
the slot, leaves the message queued, and tells the prime.

**The ceiling is the only ending.** A worker becomes terminally `finished` when its chat
reaches `WORKER_CONTEXT_CEILING_TOKENS` (400k), measured from the app's own durable session
summary — never from a model-carried counter. Crossing it does **not** interrupt work in
flight; it makes the *next* stop permanent. Workers **never Compact & Resume themselves**,
automatically or manually: the worker conversation is the agent identity, so no threshold may
open a replacement worker chat. Because workers outlive their tabs and their
prime's tab, closing the prime chat pauses the run instead of ending it: the user comes back,
the prime resumes, and the same workers are still there.

**Finish and cleanup.** `finish` is idempotent; final worker output routes to the exact prime
conversation even if parking happens on that same finish. Once no worker holds a slot, the active
incarnation releases immediately; pending reports remain in the dormant prime's inbox and retain
the same at-least-once offer/ack semantics. Dormant worker conversations remain authority fences,
including terminal rows, so stale tabs cannot fall through as ordinary unidentified chats while a
different prime is active. Orphan cleanup uses durable quiescence plus the wider in-flight
MCP/observation counters — not a heartbeat guess. Compact & Resume moves active **or dormant**
prime ownership together with session/workspace state; normal commit and recovery repair transfer
the same complete worker history to the child conversation or move nothing.

**Tests.** `agents.test.ts`, `swarm.test.ts`; the revival's browser half is in
`bridge.test.ts`, `extension.test.ts` and `content-script.test.ts`.

## 17. Renderer, IPC, connection and desktop

**Goal.** `goal.ts` sends only authored user messages and final assistant answers to
OpenRouter. **Two** persisted prompts are editable under Chat → Settings, both bounded by the
same shared limit at config and IPC: `goal.prompt` is the gate used by a chat with no goal of
its own, and `goal.objectivePrompt` is the driver used instead once a chat carries one. The
driver was a source constant until it became editable; nothing else about which one applies
changed. Both are written as meta-prompter instructions rather than as review policies — the
model is told it sits in the user's seat, given the two moves it has (next user message, or
exactly `NO_REPLY`), and taught by five worked examples each, at least one of which ends in
silence. The failure they are written against is a small model that reviews the conversation
or invents work nobody requested, because either one lands in a real composer.
An untouched persisted copy of **any** previously shipped default migrates to the current
prompt — `SUPERSEDED_GOAL_SYSTEM_PROMPTS` is walked, so an install that skipped a release is
not stranded — while customized prompts are preserved exactly. A change to either prompt
retires existing drafts so one draft never mixes old and new instructions. Terminal Goal cards persist for
visibility but their × dismissal is keyed to the finished turn, so activity repaints cannot
resurrect the card and the next Goal run still appears normally. They are presentation scoped
to the exact conversation route: New Chat, a concrete chat switch, or the user's next authored
message removes the old card immediately while async activity remains navigation-epoch guarded.
The provider boundary is non-streaming strict JSON Schema with `require_parameters`, excluded
reasoning and OpenRouter Response Healing. A fixed app-owned output protocol sits after the
editable policy prompt, and an app-owned **trailer** sits after the transcript — a long chat
pushes the instruction out of effective attention, so the closing reminder restates the two
moves where the model read last. Placement is app-owned; the policy it restates is not. Local validation is still authoritative: mixed/wrapped `NO_REPLY` stops,
tokenizer wrappers are normalized away, and malformed schema, reasoning tags, or an empty cleaned
reply fail closed before `humanReply()` or the browser can see a sendable payload.

**A chat's own goal.** The same engine, pointed the other way. The composer control is now
present in a New Chat as well (`injectControl`), because a goal written there is what writes
that chat's first message; compaction stays unavailable there and says why. `/goal/objective` stores one goal
per conversation in durable Goal state, separate from global config. Reopening the same chat
restores that text but does not itself manufacture a new Goal draft from an old finished turn. A
stored goal arms the loop for that chat even while the
standing switch is off (`goalActiveFor` in `bridge.ts`), because writing down a finish line is
the stronger statement; the worker rule still overrides both, and `/goal/objective` refuses a
worker chat outright rather than storing a goal nothing may act on. With a goal the standing
continuation policy is replaced, not augmented — the explicit finish line is the sole driver —
and the empty-conversation refusal inverts: `no_conversation`
becomes an opening message, since the goal *is* the request. A model decision that the goal is
reached stops that run but deliberately keeps the objective until the user clears/replaces it.
Compact & Resume projects the objective A→B in the same continuation transaction, including the
recovery repair path, so overnight resumptions keep the same finish line. `/goal/open` is the one goal
message not keyed by conversation: a New Chat has no id until the message is sent, so that route
holds nothing, streams nothing and is awaited by the page, which then binds the goal to the real
id once ChatGPT issues one.

**Turn outcomes the loop answers.** `completed` and `interrupted`, and no others. `interrupted`
is not the user stopping anything — `endOutcome()` reaches it only when `userStopped` is false —
it is ChatGPT closing its own turn early, which is the case the loop exists for. It was refused
alongside `stopped`/`failed`/`stalled` until 2026-08-25, and silently: session
A retained live regression shows four consecutive prime turns ending `interrupted` with answers
that said work was unfinished, none of which drew anything at all.

**Renderer/IPC.** `renderer/main.ts` is setup/permissions/connection/activity;
`renderer/chat.ts` is session timeline, handoff, swarm. To add a capability: narrow
main-process action → validate in `ipc.ts` → expose exactly that method in
`preload/index.ts` → call it. **Never add a generic `invoke(method, args)` escape hatch.**
Async loads use generation counters so a slow load for session A cannot paint over the B the
user selected, and unsolicited state pushes must not clobber a focused unsaved form field.
Captured ChatGPT HTML is untrusted: `chat.ts::renderedMessage()` allowlists semantic tags,
strips attributes, drops executable/form/embed content and non-safe link schemes.
Tests: `ipc.test.ts`, `renderer-html.test.ts`, `renderer-layout.test.ts`, `renderer-state.test.ts`.

**Connection and tunnel.** `connection.ts` owns local MCP server → Core publication →
optional Desktop publication → UI status, across the `openai`, `cloudflared` and `manual`
transports. On OpenAI tunnels **Core and Desktop need separate tunnel ids**, because the
connector UI addresses one tunnel id as one endpoint; on whole-origin transports both
tokenized paths share the origin. Lifecycle operations are serialized and generation ids
invalidate callbacks from replaced tunnels — reuse that for any new async status producer.
`tunnel/index.ts` supervises the child; `tunnel/health.ts` parses its `/metrics` and
`/api/status`. **The poll metric, not a log line, is the proof of a live route**: `/readyz`
is local and stays green through an internet outage, and a single failed long poll is a
retry, not an outage — an outage is complaints that outlive a poll cycle with no completed
poll. `diagnostics.ts` builds the UI self-test and must agree with that same grace period.
Tests: `tunnel.test.ts`.

**Desktop automation (Windows only).** `tools-desktop.ts` + `computer/*` for screenshots, UI
Automation and SendInput/clipboard. Registration-time permission is not enough: each action re-checks. The
helper is prewarmed only when native Desktop capabilities are published; window observation is
background-first and never focuses. Recent immutable frames bind coordinates to screenshot and
window geometry; semantic refs bind cached elements to bounded UIA snapshots. Physical input
revalidates the target, batches report partial completion and route evidence, and compact local
postconditions avoid model-driven wait/observe loops. Tests: `computer*.test.ts`.

**On-disk state to inspect.** Electron `userData` — `%APPDATA%\chat-on-steroids\` on Windows,
`~/Library/Application Support/chat-on-steroids/` on macOS, `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/chat-on-steroids/`
on Linux — contains `config.json` (non-secret validated settings), `sessions/` (durable history),
`state/` (small durable indexes, e.g. `request-correlations`, swarm), and the stable packaged
extension mirror used by Chrome. Credentials live through `secrets.ts`/OS safeStorage. Extension
state is separate: `chrome.storage.local` for preferences/pairing, `chrome.storage.session`
for the journal and live tab state. When a restart bug appears, **first name which process
restarted** — app, service worker, content script, Fiber helper, document, tab, or browser.
Each has a different persistence boundary.

## 19. Working in this repository

### The tree is dirty and shared

Several agents and the user may be editing at once. Before touching anything:

```powershell
git status --short
git diff -- <files you plan to touch>
```

Assume unrelated changes belong to someone else. **Never** `reset`, `checkout`, `clean`,
broad-format, or overwrite unrelated work to simplify your patch. If the exact lines you
planned to edit changed underneath you, reread and integrate — do not replay an old patch.

### The fix loop

1. Reproduce the real bug, or add a regression that **fails under the old input/ordering**.
2. Fix the earliest root cause — not the last place the wrongness became visible.
3. Run the nearest test file.
4. Run adjacent boundary tests when a protocol crosses modules.
5. `npm run verify` before calling production code done.
6. `npm run build` / package checks when bundling, native modules, resources, extension
   shipping or installer behavior could differ.

A good fix here has three parts: the root-cause change, a targeted regression, and a comment
naming the non-obvious invariant when a future "simplification" could reopen it.

**Green unit tests do not prove** a browser race, a Windows reparse race, an Electron
ordering race, a live ChatGPT Fiber shape, a process race, or resource-scale behavior. Model
the missing adversarial ordering, and use a live repro when feasible. For races prefer
epochs, generation ids, serialized mutation queues, idempotency keys, exact identity or
ownership locks — **not sleeps**, unless time really is the protocol. The reusable pattern:

```text
start A → pause A before its durable/publish step → run B to completion
        → resume A → assert B was not overwritten, resurrected or misattributed
```

Every security or identity fix needs its **negative case**: in-root native path works /
escaping native path fails; exact correlation routes / conflicting correlation does not
guess; owner polls the terminal / another worker cannot; current epoch accepts the Fiber
answer / stale epoch discards it.

**Both sides of a protocol.** A compiling one-sided edit is still broken. The multi-hop
protocols are: app↔extension bridge, content↔Fiber `postMessage`, main↔preload↔renderer
IPC, MCP schema↔handler↔recorder summary, durable store↔restart restoration.

### Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run dev                              # electron-vite dev
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --run test/<target>.test.ts
npm run verify:privacy                   # public Git identity/session/path gate
npm run verify                           # the exact CI gate: rg fetch, privacy, typecheck, full Vitest
npm run build                            # electron-vite bundles
npm run dist                             # this host OS, x64 + arm64 artifacts → release/
npm run dist:mac / dist:linux            # explicit platform families on matching hosts
npm run dist:dir:<platform>:<arch>        # one unpacked package for smoke/debug
```

Vitest uses real filesystem, real processes and real HTTP in many suites; default
test/hook timeout is 30 seconds.

### Delegating to workers

The prompt is part of the engineering work — a worker receives its task, not this
conversation. Each assignment states: project path, concrete objective, relevant subsystem
and likely files, evidence or reproduced symptoms it should inherit, constraints and
ownership boundaries, what it may edit, validation to run, and the expected handoff.

Start with the actual task. **Do not** open with canned text like "you have zero prior
context" — prefer `Fix the renderer state-clobber bug in C:\…; the confirmed symptom is …`.
Workers are already bound to their slot when launched, so nothing is asked of them about
identity. Put what every worker in the batch needs — project path, conventions file,
ownership boundaries, validation to run — in `spawn`'s `context` once; each `task` then
carries only that worker's own objective and files.

For audit-only roles make the write boundary explicit: source, tests, AppData and config
stay read-only, and each worker may create only its named report. The prime then reads the
source itself, reproduces release-blocking claims, records what it accepted or rejected, and
owns every production edit. **Parallel reports are independent hypotheses — not votes, not
proof.**

When a recurring symptom is not yet a clean issue, use the available local transcripts and
durable session metadata to follow **one** concrete request id, conversation id, worker slot
or event sequence end to end. Keep any security-sensitive reproduction material private.

## 20. Packaging and release — `electron-builder.yml`

App id `com.chatonsteroids.app`, product `Chat On Steroids`. Releases build six native
platform/architecture jobs: Windows x64/ARM64 NSIS, macOS x64/ARM64 DMG+ZIP, and Linux
x64/ARM64 AppImage+DEB. Windows stays per-user-capable, `asInvoker`, no forced elevation.

- Only `out/**` + `package.json` go into app files.
- Target-specific tunnel and ripgrep resources ship outside asar — they must execute as real files.
- `extension/` ships outside asar — Chrome's "Load unpacked" needs a real folder.
- In packaged runtime `extension-path.ts` mirrors that bundled extension to stable `userData/extension`;
  do not point Chrome directly at an AppImage's temporary mount.
- `node-pty`, Sharp/libvips and tree-sitter native payloads are staged for the exact target
  platform/arch; host-native build/prebuild leftovers must never override them.
- Uninstall/package replacement deliberately preserves per-user app data.

Before cutting a version, synchronize `package.json`, `src/main/version.ts` and
`extension/manifest.json`, and run the full suite. After installing a local build, verify
the **packaged** app really contains the target extension/tunnel/ripgrep/native runtime and can
execute its PTY/parser/image stack — a successful installer/archive build does not prove it.

`release.yml` is reusable and its matrix builds/smokes every target on a native runner, then one
`assemble` job downloads all package artifacts, creates the standalone extension ZIP and
`SHA256SUMS.txt`, and uploads one release candidate. Publishing runs through
`.github/workflows/publish.yml`, dispatched at the tag itself
(`gh workflow run publish.yml --ref vX.Y.Z`). It calls `release.yml` as a reusable workflow,
so the installers a release carries are built from the tag being published inside the run
that publishes them, and never travel between runs. A tag alone no longer builds anything.
`publish.yml` refuses a non-tag ref, refuses a tag with no reviewed
`docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`, re-checks the packaging runner's SHA-256 sums before
attaching the files, runs the public-history privacy gate again, and refuses to overwrite an
existing release. Maintainers and agents install the versioned Git hooks with
`npm run hooks:install`; those hooks reject personal maintainer identities and Claude session
provenance before it can be committed or pushed. `release.yml` on
`workflow_dispatch` still produces an unpublished candidate from any ref.

## 21. Security-sensitive areas

Some subsystems sit directly on trust boundaries and need extra review: browser/session identity,
MCP request lifecycle, approved-path enforcement, process execution, desktop control, secrets,
and resource limits. Keep public documentation focused on contracts and invariants rather than
publishing exploit recipes or detailed reproductions for unresolved weaknesses.

Before changing one of these areas, reproduce the behavior against the current tree, preserve
fail-closed behavior, add a deterministic regression where practical, and verify neighboring
negative/security cases. Suspected security issues and reproduction details belong through the
private process in `SECURITY.md`, not in public issues, comments, or fixtures.

**Do not scatter fixes across symptoms before proving the shared root.**

## 22. Definition of done

- The reproduced failure is gone **for the root reason** — not hidden in the UI, not retried
  until lucky.
- The neighboring negative / security case still holds.
- A targeted regression captures the old failure ordering or input.
- Every producer and consumer of any changed protocol agrees.
- Model-visible schema and user-visible surface still match the implementation.
- Unrelated dirty work is untouched.
- Targeted tests pass and `npm run verify` passes.
- Build/packaging checked when the changed layer can differ after bundling.
- Comments and this file updated only where behavior genuinely changed.

> **The rule.** Name the identity crossing the failing boundary, follow one concrete item
> end to end, and fix the earliest place where reality diverges from that identity or
> invariant.
