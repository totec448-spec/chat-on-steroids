<h2 align="center">Code. Delegate. Keep going.</h2>

**Work on the real project.** Let ChatGPT read and edit files, run tests, keep terminals open and use your desktop. Follow the actual tool results as they arrive.

**Give it a team.** Split independent jobs across workers, then bring their results back. Workers keep their context, so the next task can pick up where they left off.

**Stay in control of long tasks.** Send a correction while work runs. Goal follows unfinished work; Loop keeps working within your brief. Compact & Resume carries the session and worker history into a fresh chat.

<p align="center"><strong>Uses your ChatGPT conversation rather than invoking Codex directly.</strong><br /><sub>Regular Chat is separate from the shared Work/Codex allowance; ChatGPT Work uses that allowance. <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540">OpenAI usage details →</a></sub></p>

## Get started

1. **Install CoS** and approve your project folder in **Settings → Workspace**.
2. **Connect Core** through **Settings → Setup** and add it in ChatGPT’s Developer mode. [Tunnel setup →](docs/setup.md#tunnel-setup)
3. **Load the companion extension.** Click **Open extension folder**, then **Load unpacked** in Chrome’s extension settings. Pairing is automatic.
4. **Choose a model, write your task and send.**

<details>
<summary>Requirements &amp; installation notes</summary>

Windows 10/11, **macOS 13 Ventura or newer**, or a current desktop Linux. Chrome 116+ or current Edge, plus a ChatGPT account/workspace with Developer mode and custom MCP apps. [Check account availability](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-mcp-apps-in-chatgpt).

- **Unsigned beta:** Windows is not publisher-signed; macOS is unsigned and unnotarized. Verify the package against the release checksums.
- **Linux:** a Secret Service keyring is required. Prefer the DEB; when unprivileged user namespaces are disabled, the AppImage launcher can fall back to <code>--no-sandbox</code>.
- **Permissions:** choose your approved folders and review capabilities before connecting. Fresh installs enable Core capabilities and two workers; Windows also enables Desktop permissions. Shell commands run with your normal user privileges.
- **After updating:** reload the companion extension and refresh the CoS apps in ChatGPT when prompted.
