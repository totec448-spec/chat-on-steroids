/**
 * Gives the packaged macOS app a valid ad-hoc seal, and refuses to ship one that is not valid.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists for
 *
 * Issue #66: the 2.0.5 arm64 DMG launched to "the application is damaged" on macOS 27, with
 * Gatekeeper assessment already disabled — so this was a structural failure, not a policy one:
 *
 *     codesign --verify --deep --strict "Chat On Steroids.app"
 *     -> code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present
 *     codesign -dvv -> flags=0x20002(adhoc,linker-signed), Sealed Resources=none
 *
 * `linker-signed` is the giveaway. Every arm64 Mach-O gets an ad-hoc signature from the linker
 * whether anyone asks or not — it is not optional on Apple Silicon. `identity: null` tells
 * electron-builder to skip bundle signing, so the app shipped as a *bundle* carrying signed
 * Mach-Os and no `_CodeSignature/CodeResources`. macOS reads the signature on the executable,
 * looks for the resource seal it implies, finds none, and calls the bundle damaged. There was
 * never an x64-only version of this problem, which is why it appeared with Apple Silicon.
 *
 * ## Why ad-hoc rather than Developer ID
 *
 * The release policy is deliberately unsigned and unnotarized, and this does not change that.
 * An ad-hoc seal carries no Authority and no TeamIdentifier — `codesign -dvv` still reports
 * `Signature=adhoc`, and Gatekeeper still will not vouch for it. What it adds is the resource
 * envelope the executable's own signature already claims exists. The bundle stops contradicting
 * itself; it does not become trusted. Users still clear quarantine as before.
 *
 * ## Why it verifies afterwards
 *
 * The real defect was that nothing checked. The bundle audit asserted the *absence* of a seal, so
 * the broken state was the state the build required, and two releases shipped it. Signing without
 * verifying would leave the same hole one layer along, so a failed verify fails the build.
